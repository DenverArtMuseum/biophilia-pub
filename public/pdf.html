                  In the 1930s, during America’s worst financial crises, the
                  administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt employed
                  photographers to document the plight of everyday folk in the
                  Great Depression in order to push forward with their New Deal
                  programs. Documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker
                  Evans were prolific frontrunners of these efforts and their
                  extraordinary photographs continue to endure today. Their
                  artistic and documentary mastery and historical importance
                  provide key insight into a monumental turning point in
                  American history.

                  Dorothea Lange had an extraordinary life and career as a
                  prolific photographer. She worked for Arnold Genthe in his
                  portrait studio in New York and studied photography with
                  Clarence White at Columbia University. In 1918 she began to
                  travel around the world to make her living as a photographer.
                  She found herself stranded in San Francisco, so she opened a
                  photographic studio there. Paul Taylor, who would become her
                  second husband, hired her to document migratory workers in
                  California.

                  In 1935 she began to work for the Resettlement Administration,
                  later known as the Farm Security Administration. During this
                  period, she made her most famous image,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-1"><em>Human Erosion in California (Migrant Mother)</em></a>, of Native American Florence Owens Thompson and her children
                  in a pea-pickers’ camp. Other less famous subjects included
                  Japanese internment camps and scenes of workers in factories
                  during World War II. Lange became the first woman awarded a
                  Guggenheim fellowship, and she spent nearly ten years making
                  photo essays for <em>Life</em> and other magazines. She also
                  traveled extensively, making photo essays in Vietnam, Ireland,
                  Pakistan, India, and elsewhere.

                  Walker Evans began to photograph in the late 1920s, making
                  snapshots during a European trip. Upon his return to New York,
                  he published his first images in 1930. During the Great
                  Depression, Evans began to photograph for the Resettlement
                  Administration, later known as the Farm aecurity
                  Administration (FSA), documenting workers and architecture in
                  the Southeastern states. In 1936 he traveled with the writer
                  James Agee to illustrate an article on tenant farm families
                  for <em>Fortune</em> magazine; the book
                  <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em> came out of this
                  collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout his career Evans contributed photographs to
                  numerous publications, including three devoted solely to his
                  work. In 1965 he left Fortune, where he had been a staff
                  photographer for twenty years, to become a professor of
                  photography and graphic design at Yale University. He remained
                  in the position until 1974, a year before his death.

                  When Evans was officially hired in October 1935 as an
                  Information Specialist by the Historical Section of the
                  Resettlement Administration, his duties were described as
                  follows: “Under the general supervision of the Chief of the
                  Historical Section with wide latitude for the exercise of
                  independent judgement and decision as Senior Information
                  Specialist to carry out special assignments in the field;
                  collect, compile and create photographic material to
                  illustrate factual and interpretive news releases and other
                  informational material upon all problems, progress and
                  activities of the Resettlement Administration.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn1" id="page-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Evans was to make liberal use of his right to exercise
                  “independent judgement” during his time with the RA, and he
                  perpetually resisted the idea that his purpose there was to
                  gather illustrations for the promotion of the RA’s (that is,
                  the federal government’s New Deal) programs. While considering
                  a position with the RA in the spring of 1935, he jotted down
                  those things he would require of his employer, including the
                  “guarantee of one-man performance,” and what he would provide,
                  adding that he should not be asked to do anything more in the
                  way of political propaganda: “[I] Mean never [to] make
                  photographic statements for the government or do photographic
                  chores for gov or anyone in gov, no matter how powerful—this
                  is pure record not propaganda. The value and, if you like,
                  even the propaganda value for the government lies in the
                  record itself which in the long run will prove an intelligent
                  and farsighted thing to have done. NO POLITICS whatever.”

                  Because his pictures had been issued by the agency with
                  policy-approved captions for the past three years, Evans felt
                  the need in 1938 to distance himself from that establishment,
                  as well as the world of commercial publishing, by prefacing
                  <em>American Photographs</em> with this statement: “The
                  responsibility for the selection of the pictures used in this
                  book has rested with the author, and the choice has been
                  determined by his opinion: therefore they are presented
                  without sponsorship or connection with the policies, aesthetic
                  or political, of any of the institutions, publications or
                  government agencies for which some of the work has been
                  done.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn2" id="page-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Stryker’s business was to provide informative images to the
                  mass media, and he and Evans would always disagree about the
                  most appropriate vehicle for the latter’s photographs, as well
                  as the definition of “documentary.” But when the photography
                  project of the RA began, the two men were able to agree on its
                  primary subject: American history as exemplified by life in
                  the average American town. Evans’s vision for documenting
                  American life had begun to form much earlier; a letter drafted
                  to his friend Ernestine Evans, an editor at J. B. Lippincott,
                  in February of 1934, makes clear his aspirations:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    What do I want to do? … I know now is the time for picture
                    books. An American city is the best, Pittsburgh better than
                    Washington. I know more about such a place. I would want to
                    visit several besides Pittsburgh before deciding. Something
                    perhaps smaller. Toledo, Ohio, maybe. Then I’m not sure a
                    book of photos should be identified locally. American city
                    is what I’m after… People, all classes, surrounded by
                    bunches of the new down-and-out. Automobiles and the
                    automobile landscape. Architecture, American urban taste,
                    commerce, small scale, large scale, the city street
                    atmosphere, the street smell, the hateful stuff, women’s
                    clubs, fake culture, bad education, religion in decay…<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn3" id="page-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The two men could find common ground in part due to the
                  widespread influence of the 1929 publication
                  <em>Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</em> by
                  Robert and Helen Lynd, professors of sociology at Columbia and
                  Sarah Lawrence, respectively. A 550-page field investigation
                  by social anthropologists with subject headings including
                  “What Middletown does to get its living” and “The houses in
                  which Middletown lives,” this pioneering project attempted an
                  objective analysis of life in a small Midwestern American city
                  (Muncie, Indiana). The Lynds’ study was hailed as a very
                  accessible report that was most appealing because it made “no
                  attempt to prove anything” but simply recorded “what was
                  observed.” The Lynds introduced their topic by saying their
                  goal “was to study synchronously the interwoven trends that
                  are the life of a small American city. A typical city,
                  strictly speaking, does not exist, but the city studied was
                  selected a shaving many features in common to a wide group of
                  communities.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Lynd 1929, 3</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Lynd, Robert S., and Helen Merrell Lynd.

                  The “Outline Memorandum” that Evans prepared in October 1935,
                  probably at Stryker’s request, laying out plans for an

                  reference to Middletown and presents thoughts similar to the
                  photographer’s musings of 1934:

                  This document goes on to list antebellum plantation
                  architecture in Natchez, Mississippi; small rural French towns
                  in Teche Parish, Louisiana; industrial themes in Birmingham,
                  Alabama; and a cotton plantation in South Carolina, as
                  objectives of the proposed trip for gathering still
                  photography of a “general sociological nature.” In early 1936,
                  one of <em>Middletown’s</em> authors had a chance to directly
                  affect the RA’s Photography Section: Stryker showed Robert
                  Lynd, a former Columbia colleague, some RA pictures and asked
                  for his opinion while lunching with him in New York. The
                  result was a “shooting script” for “things which should be
                  photographed as American Background,” issued by Stryker to his
                  team of photographers. The script contains an extensive
                  listing of items like “People on and off the job,” “How do
                  people look?,” “The wall decoration in homes as an index to
                  the different income groups and their reactions,” and “A
                  photographic study of use of leisure time in various income
                  groups.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn5" id="page-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                  Once Evans was officially on staff, his first trip under
                  Stryker’s direction seems to have been an extended fall visit
                  to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where steel mills, workers’
                  housing, parading legionnaires, and elaborate gravestones (<a class="ref" data-annotation-ids="" data-figure-id="fig-1" data-region="" data-sequence-index="null" data-sequence-transition="30" href="#page-null">Figure 1</a>,

                  Evans made two lengthy road trips that would account for the
                  bulk of his entire production for the RA and many of the 169
                  mid-thirties pictures that follow this essay. From November to
                  mid-January, here turned to industrial centers in
                  Pennsylvania, finally spending some time in Pittsburgh, and
                  went on to Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi,
                  and Louisiana, following to some extent the course outlined in
                  the memorandum above. In February 1936, he left again, with a
                  completely Southern itinerary that would take him through many
                  small cities, some of them renowned for ante-bellum
                  architecture and Civil War battles, in Louisiana, Mississippi,
                  Alabama, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, and Virginia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the spring of 1936, Stryker approved a furlough for Evans
                  to work on a <em>Fortune</em> story with James Agee. This
                  leave for mid-July through mid-September allowed Evans to
                  return to the “middle south” with Agee to prepare “an article
                  on cotton tenantry in the United States, in the form of a
                  photographic and verbal record of the daily lives and
                  environment of an average white family of tenant farmers” (<a class="ref" data-annotation-ids="" data-figure-id="fig-4" data-region="" data-sequence-index="null" data-sequence-transition="30" href="#page-null">Figure 4</a>
                  and
                  <a class="ref" data-annotation-ids="" data-figure-id="fig-5" data-region="" data-sequence-index="null" data-sequence-transition="30" href="#page-null">Figure 5</a>).

                  <em>Fortune’s</em> art editor, the pictures Evans produced on
                  this job would become the property of the RA after the
                  magazine had run the finished essay in a fall issue.

                  Once Evans returned from this trip south, during which he and
                  Agee documented the lives of the Burroughs, Fields, and Tengle
                  families in Alabama (see
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-3"><em>Bud Fields with His Wife</em></a>
                  and <a href="#page-catalogue-4"><em>Burrough’s Family</em></a>), he spent September and October printing his pictures and
                  preparing presentations for both <em>Fortune</em> and
                  Stryker.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn6" id="page-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  Stryker again talked about a New England trip, on which he
                  planned to accompany the photographer, but it did not
                  materialize, and Evans was once more sent to the South, this
                  time to photograph the catastrophe of flooding in Arkansas and
                  Tennessee. An unusual and demanding assignment for Evans, this
                  trip of late January and February 1937 was made with another
                  RA photographer, Edwin Locke, and required that he spend
                  considerable time in the affected area, photographing the
                  flood victims and their temporary shelters.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This would be his last travel for the RA, an agency that was
                  absorbed into the Farm Security Administration at about this
                  time. Evans’s contributions to the RA’s documentation of
                  Depression-era America had essentially been obtained between
                  the summer of 1935 and the spring of 1936, a period of less
                  than a year. The Alabama pictures made while on leave to
                  <em>Fortune</em> would become his best-known photographs and,
                  ironically, those most closely identified with his work as a
                  New Deal photographer.

                      The first publication of this renowned image occurred on
                      March 11, 1936, on the third day that the San Francisco
                      News ran a story about the pea pickers’ camp at Nipomo. It
                      was also featured as a full-page reproduction in September
                      1936 issue of <em>Survey Graphic</em>, titled
                      “Draggin’-Around People” and captioned “A blighted pea
                      crop in California in 1935 left the pickers without work.
                      This family sold their tent to get food.” Also in this
                      issue was an article by Taylor entitled “From the Group
                      Up.” His report on demonstration projects of the New
                      Deal’s Resettlement Administration in Arizona, Utah, New
                      Mexico, and California was illustrated with four more
                      picture by Lange.

                    <p>
                      Since it was first published, this composition, best known
                      as <em>Migrant Mother</em>, has come to represent not only
                      the pictorial archive created by the RA/FSA during the
                      1930s but also the Great Depression itself. Posters and
                      other publicity of later activists fighting racial,
                      economic, and political oppression have borrowed from
                      Lange’s icon of the time. The

                      <a class="ref" data-annotation-ids="" data-figure-id="cat-1" data-region="120,1350,1706,1806" data-sequence-index="null" data-sequence-transition="30" href="#page-null">young</a>

                      proved to be universal attributes. With Lange’s artistry,
                      Owens took on the timeless quality of Eugéne Delacroix’s
                      strong female rebel (<em>Liberty Leading the People</em>),
                      Jean-François Millet’s peasant woman (the agrarian ideal),
                      Honoré Daumier’s laundresses (the working woman) and Käthe
                      Kollwitz’s proletarian woman warrior (one of the mothers
                      leading her <em>Peasants’ War</em>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Owens, although she became famous, did not enjoy, even
                      momentarily, the life of a celebrity. She had three more
                      children and kept moving with her family, following the
                      California crops. She did become involved in efforts to
                      organize farm labor and would sometimes serve as the straw
                      boss, one who negotiates wages for migrants as the picking
                      season begins. She was still working in the fields at age
                      fifty before finally marrying again (to George Thompson)
                      and settling into a stable life in Modesto, California.

                      Several Lange images from the same photoshoot with Owens
                      and her children exist
                      <a href="#page-https-guides-loc-gov-migrant-mother-introduction" target="_blank">in other collections</a>. These give us the chance to consider the many varied
                      choices in composition that Lange made in producing her
                      iconic final image.

                      From mid-July to mid-September 1936, Evans took a leave
                      from his position as an information specialist for the
                      Historical Section of the Resettlement Administration to
                      work with the writer James Agee on an assignment for
                      <em>Fortune</em> magazine. They traveled to the Deep South
                      to prepare an article on tenant cotton farming. In Alabama
                      they documented the lives of farmers, including the Fields
                      family. Evans found in this average American household the
                      archetypal portrait of the everyman that he treasured. The
                      straight-forward style of this portrait emphasizes the
                      family’s hard life as much as their pride.
