<div class="poem">
<p>Seedless golden tears,</p>
<p>ferns bound to flesh at off angles,</p>
<p>busted out rez towns,</p>
<p>hemming us in with a cloak of mosses.</p>
<p>The orchestration needs tufts of black shadow,</p>
<p>incidental notes to weigh it down, the blanket depicts a field and loon.</p>
<p>I said we once formed kingdoms at the foot of a vanishing stone.</p>
<p>What was it I said that they said?</p>
<p>“Vividness is Self-Selecting”</p>
<p>several points flowing together in stonework.</p>
<p>I only use words like stones because we are far away.</p>
<p>We corrupt a landscape through the planting of foreign flowers.</p>
<p>Borders are so often theorized as division</p>
<p>wending along with a spot of sunlight,</p>
<p class="indent">“The bone frame was made</p>
<p class="indent">for</p>
<p class="indent">no such shock, knit within</p>
<p class="indent">terror</p>
<p class="indent">yet the skeleton stood up to it.”</p>
<p class="indent">They are not artifacts but fit to our hand,</p>
<p class="indent">our daily voice,</p>
<p class="indent">the short mouth line erased.</p>
<p class="indent">The marsh revels in its glitter</p>
<p class="indent">and occasional cranberry.</p>
<p class="indent">The subject is left purposely unstable,</p>
<p class="indent">we will not be robbed of continuum.</p>
<p class="indent">The shells fly out from the dress,</p>
<p class="indent">on strings, according</p>
<p class="indent">to demands left in the music.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain stories are told in full frog regalia,</p>
<p class="indent">the music is allowed its wet set of wings</p>
<p class="indent">and room to lie down.</p>
<p class="indent">Words arranged for prayer</p>
<p class="indent">are in fact geometric forms</p>
<p class="indent">or portraits of poets themselves,</p>
<p class="indent">uncovering the dictates of a graven line.</p>
<p class="indent">Orlando, are we even</p>
<p class="indent">allowing ourselves the present</p>
<p class="indent">moment anymore?</p>
<p class="indent">There are still two blankets that sit on either side</p>
<p class="indent">Reimagining can take place at the root of time,</p>
<p class="indent">out of all necessity</p>
<p class="indent">we convert the elements</p>
<p class="indent">as a matter of course.</p>
