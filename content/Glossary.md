##### Affective Ecology {#affective-ecology}
a new branch of ecology concerned with emotional relationships between human beings and the rest of the living world

##### Algorithm {#algorithm}
a process or set of rules to be followed to solve a mathematical problem or perform a computation

##### Algorithmic Design {#algorithmic-design}

##### Attention Restoration Theory (ART) {#attention-restoration-theory}
a theory that holds that mental fatigue and concentration can be improved by time spent in or looking at nature. According to Stephen Kaplan, the natural environment must have four properties in order to provide this restorative effect: 1) extent (the scope to feel immersed in the environment); 2) being away (providing an escape from habitual activities); 3) soft fascination (aspects of the environment that capture attention effortlessly); and 4) compatibility (individuals must want to be exposed to, and appreciate, the environment).

##### Awe {#awe}
a feeling of reverential respect mixed with wonder or fear, often in response to that which is considered sacred or sublime


### B {#b}

##### Biodiversity {#biodiversity}
the variety and variability of life forms in a particular ecosystem, region, or the entire planet. It encompasses the multitude of species of plants, animals, fungi, microorganisms, and their interactions within their environment.

##### Biome {#biome}
a large naturally occurring community of flora and fauna occupying a major habitat, e.g., forest or tundra

##### Biomimicry {#biomimicry}
the design and production of materials, structures, and systems that are modeled on biological entities and processes

##### Biomorphism {#biomorphism}
a twentieth-century style of painting, sculpture, photography, and design with roots in the late nineteenth century; a painted, drawn, or sculptured free form or design suggestive in shape of a living organism, especially an ameba or protozoan. Biomorphic forms or images are ones that while abstract nevertheless refer to, or evoke, living forms such as plants and the human body.

##### Biophilia {#biophilia}
the innate tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes

##### Biophilic Design {#biophilic-design}
the process of basing decisions about the built environment on intuition or credible research—derived from either an appetency for nature or measurable biological responses—to achieve the best possible health outcomes

##### Biophobia fear or aversion to nature {#biophobia-fear}

##### Botanical {#botanical}
relating to plants

##### Built Environment {#built-environment}
places and spaces created or modified by people with particular emphasis on buildings, parks, streetscapes, and other spaces that provide the setting for human activity


### C {#c}

##### Climate change {#climate-change}
long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, either natural or caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels.


### D {#d}

##### Deep Ecology {#deep-ecology}
 an environmental philosophy based in the belief that humans must radically change their relationship to nature from one that values nature solely for its usefulness to human beings to one that recognizes that nature has an inherent value. Sometimes called an “ecosophy,” deep ecology is a social movement that sometimes has religious and mystical undertones. The phrase originated in 1972 with Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess.


### E {#e}

##### Ecological Aesthetic Theory {#ecological-aesthetic-theory}
proclaims that knowledge about the ecological functions of a landscape will increase preference ratings for that landscape. The theory depends on knowledge as a key driver of landscape preference.

##### Ecology {#ecology}
as a scientific discipline, the branch of biology that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings; in a social or political context, the political movement that seeks to protect the environment, especially from pollution; often associated with environmentalism

##### Ecopsychology {#ecopsychology}
the study of the relationship between human beings and the natural world through ecological and psychological principles. The field seeks to develop and understand ways of expanding the emotional connection between individuals and the natural world, thereby assisting individuals with developing sustainable lifestyles and remedying alienation from nature.

##### Ecosystem {#ecosystem}
a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment

##### Emergence {#emergence}
in evolutionary theory, as life evolves, new forms and systems arise that possess qualities and behaviors that are not simply the sum of their parts or a straightforward consequence of the conditions that preceded them. This concept highlights the inherent complexity and unpredictability of evolutionary processes.

##### Environmental Generational Amnesia {#environmental-generational-amnesia}
the generational perception that the environment into which it’s born, no matter how developed, urbanized or polluted, is the norm. As a result, what each generation comes to think of as “nature” is relative, based on exposure.

##### Environmental Psychology {#environmental-psychology}
an interdisciplinary practice that studies the relationship between human behavior and the environment, from both directions—how the environment affects behavior and how people’s behaviors and attitudes affect the environment

##### Environmental Quality {#environmental-quality}
an umbrella term that refers to the sum of the properties and characteristics of a specific environment and how it affects human beings and other organisms


### F {#f}

##### Fractal {#fractal}
a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems—the pictures of chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions and can be found in trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc.


### G {#g}

##### Generative Design {#generative-design}
the process of using algorithms to generate a batch of design options for evaluation


### H {#h}

##### Heraclitean Motion {#heraclitean-motion}
a pattern of movement that always changes, yet always stays the same; examples are the movement of trees or grasses in a light breeze, aquarium fish, or the pattern of light and shade created by cumulus clouds

##### Homeland {#homeland}
a place where a cultural, national, or racial identity has formed; often associated with a sense of belonging, identity, and attachment to the place where one was born, grew up, or has significant cultural, historical, or emotional ties; does not necessarily adhere to geographical boundaries and can encompass cultural heritage, shared values, traditions, and a feeling of being rooted in a particular place.

##### Human Ecology Theory {#human-ecology-theory}
a theoretical framework that considers the interactions of humans with their environments, including biological, social, and physical aspects, as a system


### I {#i}

##### Inherent {#inherent}
existing in something as a permanent, essential, or characteristic attribute; involved in the constitution or essential character of something; belonging by nature or habit; intrinsic

##### Innate {#innate}
inborn; natural; originating in the mind; existing in, belonging to, or determined by factors present in an individual from birth; belonging to the essential nature of something; inherent; originating in or derived from the mind or the constitution of the intellect rather than from experience

##### Intrinsic {#intrinsic}
belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing; originating or due to causes within a body, organ, or part; originating and included wholly within an organ or part


### M {#m}

##### Morphogenesis {#morphogenesis}
formation of the structure of an organism or part; differentiation and growth of tissues during development; concerns the fundamental question of how biological form and structure are generated


### N {#n}

##### Nastic Movement {#nastic-movement}
a nondirectional response to environmental stimuli (e.g., temperature, humidity, light irradiance) usually associated with plants

##### Nature {#nature}
the phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, microorganisms, their ecosystems, and evolutionary and geologic processes; in the broadest sense, the natural, physical, or material world or universe

##### Natural phenomena {#natural-phenomena}
events that occur in nature without human involvement. Natural phenomena can be physical, biological, or chemical and can occur regularly, like the seasonal blooming of trees or flowers, or irregularly, such as lightning.

##### Nyctinasty {#nyctinasty}
a circadian rhythm–based nastic movement (as the opening and closing of some flowers) that is associated with diurnal changes of temperature or light intensity; a highly evolved natural process that protects delicate structures and conserves resources when conditions are not optimal


### P {#p}

##### Parametric Design {#parametric-design}
the process of using parameters and rules to create a design solution that is easily modified

##### Placemaking {#placemaking}
a multi-faceted approach to the planning, design, and management of public spaces, capitalizing on a local community’s assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating public spaces that promote people’s health, happiness, and well being


### S {#s}

##### Sociobiology {#sociobiology}
a field of scientific study based on the assumption that social behavior has resulted from evolution

##### Soft Fascination {#soft-fascination}
a key component of natural environments that encourages restoration; a stimulus that initiates the use of involuntary attention, or attention that requires no effort, e.g., bird song, the sound of wind blowing through the trees, clouds, a sunrise or sunset, or a flowing stream or river

##### Somatic {#somatic}
relating to the body, especially as distinct from the mind

##### Stimulus {#stimulus}
