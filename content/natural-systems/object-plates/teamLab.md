Art collective teamLab considers their work to exist outside of boundaries. In form, it incorporates elements of fine art, technology, immersive spectacle, and natural imagery. More importantly to the artists, however, it seeks to traverse the barriers that exist between people and the natural world or each other. In *Flowers and People—A Whole Year per Hour*, vibrant blossoms erupt and fade across multiple screens. Resembling illuminated paper cutouts, the flowers grow and dissolve according to to programming that continuously renders the imagery in response to real-time actions of visitors. As people spend time with the work, flowers bloom abundantly in front of them; when they move away, the petals scatter and disappear. *Flowers and People* transforms through visitor presence, expressing the fundamental effects of human action on nature. In this case, humans are the catalyst for beauty and growth, and their absence creates a void, aligning with teamLab’s ultimate thematic goal to “create an experience where the relationship between the world and oneself is borderless and continuous.”[^1]

The movement and colors of *Flowers and People* become more dramatic as more people interact with it, encouraging affiliation with the actions of other viewers. By inspiring a sense of awe through a community encounter, teamLab hopes that visitors will begin to think of the presence of other people as beautiful or beneficial, rather than a hindrance to one’s own experience.[^2] Recent scientific and psychological studies of awe suggest that this could be correct: people who report feelings of awe, wonder, or transcendence were recorded as behaving more generously, being more curious, and wanting to connect more with others afterward.[^3] It is fitting that both nouns in the title of the work are plural: much like life itself, *Flowers and People* is meant to be a shared event.
