For architect Jeanne Gang and her eponymous firm Studio Gang, design and architecture should make cities better places. This does not just apply to the cosmetic alteration of a skyline but to a reduction of environmental harm and a concrete improvement in the lives of its users. Studio Gang calls this approach “actionable idealism,” and it guides their research-based and localized process.[^1]

In Denver, Studio Gang’s Populus hotel rises from a triangular junction of three busy Denver streets. The building’s bright façade and varied, oval-shaped windows are a motif that is familiar for many Coloradans: they resemble the white bark and dark “eyes” of aspen trees. On an aspen, these characteristic marks are left behind as the trees self-prune, shedding their lower branches to expose more of the photosynthetic bark, which absorbs light and energy year-round. For Populus, the eye-shaped windows, the largest of which are thirty feet high, accomplish the same effect, providing light, views, and, for some hotel rooms, built-in seating. Extended “lids” over each window redirect rainwater and create shade as an efficient response to the harsh Denver climate; these considerations of local and environmental impacts can also be seen in the architects’ decision to have no onsite parking, encouraging visitors to bike, use public transit, or explore the neighborhood on foot.

Aesthetics are not the only similarity between the hotel and aspens. A cluster of aspens seems to be made of many individual trees (fig. 1), but they are all extensions of the same vast, underground root network, a single part of a larger organism. In the same way, Populus is informed by and will impact downtown Denver as a whole, despite being just one building. By drawing on a quintessential aspect of the regional environment, Studio Gang designed the building to resonate with local residents, adding retail, restaurants, and a public rooftop garden and view deck to create opportunities for connection and community (fig. 2). While Populus takes its name from an aspen’s scientific classification, *Populus tremuloides*, the homophone “populace”—the inhabitants of a designated place—is also an apt moniker.
