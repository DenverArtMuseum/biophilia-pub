short_title:

description:
  one_line: "*Biophilia: Nature Reimagined* brings together more than seventy imaginative works, including architectural models and photographs, objects, fashion, digital installations, and immersive art experiences that collectively highlight the transformative power of nature."
  full: 'Biophilia is a term popularized by American biologist and author Edward O. Wilson to describe his theory that, as humans have evolved as a species, they have been intricately intertwined with the natural world. Wilson’s hypothesis invites deep reflection and poses relevant questions for audiences to consider regarding life in our hyper-accelerated digital and urban-centric world. Organized by Darrin Alfred, Curator of Architecture and Design, *Biophilia* provides a space for leading architects, artists, and designers to reexamine and reanimate our intrinsic bond with the natural world. The exhibition features works by an international roster of designers and artists including Iris van Herpen, Studio Gang, teamLab, Joris Laarman and DRIFT, among others.'
