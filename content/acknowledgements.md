I owe immense thanks to the outstanding team at the Denver Art Museum for their collaboration and execution of this significant undertaking. I am grateful to Christoph Heinrich, Frederick and Jan Mayer Director, and Chief Curator Angelica Daneo for their encouragement and commitment to the project. I am greatly indebted to Kit Bernal, Curatorial Assistant, who tended to all aspects of the exhibition and publication with patience and care. Kit’s written contributions significantly enhanced the content of this publication. Melissa Maichele, former Curatorial Intern, provided valuable input into the project’s early development. Melissa’s research strategy, balancing depth with breadth and incorporating diverse interdisciplinary concepts, laid a solid foundation.

I am grateful to Holly Harmon, Interpretive Specialist, for her role in shaping the exhibition’s interpretative strategies. Holly’s dedication and expertise were instrumental in engaging with our Community Advisory Panel—Juan Carlos Baños, Parker McMullen Bushman, Julietta Dasilva, Sunaina Madhav Dasi, Stephen Esparza, Cindy Frantz, Andy Hartman, Damon McLeese, David Taus, and Zara Vargues. I extend my thanks to these individuals for their unique insights and thoughtful feedback, which greatly enriched the project.

I am truly appreciative of our talented Publications team. Valerie Hellstein, Managing Editor, skillfully supervised numerous aspects of the publication’s production and edited the manuscript alongside Leslie Murrell, Editor, with care. Special thanks to Matt Popke, Developer, and Darcy Christ, who meticulously developed and designed the publication. I am especially thankful to Kimberly Ruffin, Cedar Sigo, and Florence Williams. Their thoughtful and illuminating contributions added depth and richness to this publication. Special thanks are due to Seana Quinn and Devin Tellatin at *Emergence Magazine* for granting permission to include “A Forest Walk.”

The exhibition was beautifully designed by Brian Dale and Meredith Dale of Sort Studio and complemented by graphics from Matt Rue of McGINTY Co. James Durée, Designer and Animator, Abby Gibbons, Graphics Assistant, and Cathy Trekloff, Producer, of Milkhaus, created the mood-setting title wall and interactive wall design and animation. Benjamin Auten, Project Manager, and Chandan Kumar, Lead Developer/Programmer, of ShadowComm Digital Strategy & Solutions designed and developed the interactive wall Web app data visualization. The combined contributions of these individuals gently captivate the senses. Installation was expertly photographed by James Florio.
