The effects of time in nature on humans’ well-being have been thoroughly and scientifically investigated over the last few decades, with documented results including decreases in cortisol and heart rate. In Japan, people who spent time walking through forests also reported feeling comfortable, soothed, or refreshed afterward.[^1] For certified nature and forest therapy guide Kimberly Ruffin, nature is also an experience of faith, which she defines in this forest walk as “a continuous exchange of belonging.”

This audio-guided walk is an invitation to engage your senses and be present in your body and in place. While it’s called a forest walk, it can be done in any outdoor setting, although it should be a site that’s already familiar to you, such as a favorite hiking trail, a city park, or even your own backyard. Set aside about forty-five minutes for this experience, but you can take more time if you’d like. When you are ready, press play and let Kimberly guide you through nature and reflection.
