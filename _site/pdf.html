                  In the 1930s, during America’s worst financial crises, the
                  administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt employed
                  photographers to document the plight of everyday folk in the
                  Great Depression in order to push forward with their New Deal
                  programs. Documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker
                  Evans were prolific frontrunners of these efforts and their
                  extraordinary photographs continue to endure today. Their
                  artistic and documentary mastery and historical importance
                  provide key insight into a monumental turning point in
                  American history.

                <p>
                  Here in Denver, Colorado, we are fortunate to have so many
                  opportunities to find ourselves in nature: to explore aspen
                  forests, to hike along pristine alpine lakes, and to climb
                  majestic mountains. For centuries, people have been partaking
                  in the health benefits of Colorado’s environment and weather.
                  It has also become clearer, with the ravages and
                  unpredictability of climate change, that these connections to
                  nature can be tenuous and fragile but are more important than
                  ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In our fast-paced and always-connected world, what better
                  place than a museum to slow down and ground ourselves in the
                  present?
                  <a href="#page-https-d26jxt5097u8sr-cloudfront-net-file-share-art-20museums-20and-20well-being-pdf" target="_blank">Many researchers and professionals agree that art and art
                    museums offer beneficial avenues for personal and social
                    well-being</a>
                  through broadening our mindsets, promoting creativity and
                  connection, and allowing us to build our long-term
                  intellectual, social, and psychological resources.

                <p>
                  The exhibition <em>Biophilia: Nature Reimagined</em> presents
                  an alternative way of understanding ourselves and our
                  environment in the face of our growing separation and
                  estrangement from the natural world due to developing
                  technologies and inequalities. It highlights the ways in which
                  a wide range of creatives, including designers, architects,
                  and artists, continue to cultivate our deep psychological,
                  emotional, and spiritual connections with nature. Of course,
                  there are many prongs to these issues, but this exhibition
                  does not focus on the greening of our built environment,
                  sustainability, or combatting climate change. While rooted in
                  science, <em>Biophilia</em> impacts visitors on an emotional
                  level. Many of the works are performative or multisensory, and
                  they all are eclectic and innovative responses to our inherent
                  connection to nature. Further, many of them aim to foster
                  connections between people, creating visually nourishing
                  experiences that prompt positive emotional responses and
                  transform our way of understanding ourselves and our place in
                  the natural world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We invite visitors and readers to reflect on their own
                  relationship with nature and how it affects, or can affect,
                  their physical and mental health and their attitudes toward
                  their environments and others. Through the exhibition, we hope
                  many become more conscious about their values and actions and
                  are inspired to take action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I’d like to thank Darrin Alfred, Curator of Architecture and
                  Design, for this compelling exhibition, and Kit Bernal,
                  Curatorial Assistant, Architecture and Design, for her
                  research and contributions to the catalog. Many thanks must
                  also be given to all of the lenders as well as the designers
                  and artists who contributed their work and created new pieces
                  for this exhibition.

                  Dorothea Lange had an extraordinary life and career as a
                  prolific photographer. She worked for Arnold Genthe in his
                  portrait studio in New York and studied photography with
                  Clarence White at Columbia University. In 1918 she began to
                  travel around the world to make her living as a photographer.
                  She found herself stranded in San Francisco, so she opened a
                  photographic studio there. Paul Taylor, who would become her
                  second husband, hired her to document migratory workers in
                  California.

                  In 1935 she began to work for the Resettlement Administration,
                  later known as the Farm Security Administration. During this
                  period, she made her most famous image,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-1"><em>Human Erosion in California (Migrant Mother)</em></a>, of Native American Florence Owens Thompson and her children
                  in a pea-pickers’ camp. Other less famous subjects included
                  Japanese internment camps and scenes of workers in factories
                  during World War II. Lange became the first woman awarded a
                  Guggenheim fellowship, and she spent nearly ten years making
                  photo essays for <em>Life</em> and other magazines. She also
                  traveled extensively, making photo essays in Vietnam, Ireland,
                  Pakistan, India, and elsewhere.

                  Walker Evans began to photograph in the late 1920s, making
                  snapshots during a European trip. Upon his return to New York,
                  he published his first images in 1930. During the Great
                  Depression, Evans began to photograph for the Resettlement
                  Administration, later known as the Farm aecurity
                  Administration (FSA), documenting workers and architecture in
                  the Southeastern states. In 1936 he traveled with the writer
                  James Agee to illustrate an article on tenant farm families
                  for <em>Fortune</em> magazine; the book
                  <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em> came out of this
                  collaboration.

                <p>
                  Throughout his career Evans contributed photographs to
                  numerous publications, including three devoted solely to his
                  work. In 1965 he left Fortune, where he had been a staff
                  photographer for twenty years, to become a professor of
                  photography and graphic design at Yale University. He remained
                  in the position until 1974, a year before his death.

                  Throughout history, architects, artists, and designers have
                  turned to nature as a source of inspiration and solace during
                  challenging times and periods of societal crisis, seeking to
                  find harmony, connection, and meaning in the world. The Arts
                  and Crafts movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
                  centuries emerged as a response to industrialization and
                  urbanization. The movement sought to revive traditional
                  craftsmanship and celebrate the beauty of natural forms.
                  Similarly, the mid-twentieth-century organic design movement
                  was influenced by a desire to create more harmonious
                  relationships between humans and their environment, countering
                  the still lingering negative effects of industrialization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The idea that nature can serve as an antidote to technology is
                  a perspective that many people have held over the years. This
                  perspective often arises from concerns about the potential
                  negative effects of technology on various aspects of human
                  life and society. But many designs inspired by nature benefit
                  from the use of technology to replicate or adapt natural forms
                  and structures. These designs often result in highly
                  efficient, structurally logical, and innovative products,
                  systems, or innovations. This concept remains an influential
                  force in shaping contemporary art and design, offering new
                  responses to our relationship with the natural world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natural analogs in architecture, art, and design evoke
                  naturally occurring forms and patterns and aim to establish
                  connections between humans and the natural world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn1" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Architects, artists, and designers simulate nature’s boundless
                  shapes, structures, and organizing principles, expressed in a
                  broad spectrum of forms and functions, from appropriating
                  biomorphic forms to mimicking nature’s underlying geometries
                  and processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following objects and projects from the fields of
                  architecture, art, and design do not simply imitate nature but
                  use it as a starting point for eclectic and innovative
                  responses to our relationship with our environment. They
                  highlight the uniqueness and dynamism that nature’s forms and
                  patterns have to affect us, tapping into our intimate,
                  emotional, and spiritual connections with the natural world.
                  Natural analogs foster a deeper appreciation for nature’s
                  aesthetics, stimulate feelings of wonder, and promote a sense
                  of responsibility for preserving and coexisting with the
                  natural environment.

                <p><strong>Form</strong></p>
                <p>
                  The appropriation of diverse natural forms can lead to the
                  creation of aesthetically pleasing and emotionally satisfying
                  objects. By capturing the beauty of nature in fixed form,
                  artists and designers create captivating environments and
                  imbue spaces with a sense of tranquility and wonder. While our
                  brain knows that these objects are not living things, we
                  describe them as symbolic representations of life.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn2" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>

                  Sandra Davolio’s delicately handcrafted porcelain vessels take
                  inspiration from the organic structures of coral typically
                  found in the sunlit shallows of tropical seas. Achieving a
                  diversity akin to their real-life counterparts, no two works
                  are alike. Paperlike in texture,
                  <em>Coral Flower IV</em> &lt;link to Kit’s plate with
                  images&gt; fans outward with organic ripples, its unglazed
                  exterior retaining a finish and texture reminiscent of coral
                  fragments washed onto the shore. Similarly, Ronan and Erwan
                  Bouroullec’s <em>Algues (Algae)</em> take cues from the
                  diverse organisms that play crucial roles in our aquatic
                  ecosystems. (cat. xx, EXACC.2023.78 FPO) The interlocking
                  plastic modules can be assembled into endless configurations
                  to form partitions of varying sizes and densities, allowing
                  light to filter through their lacy structure like algae’s
                  captivating translucency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  David Valner’s <em>Fungus</em> vases and bowls conjure the
                  peculiar forms found in the fascinating world of fungi: from
                  delicate and elongated stalks to intricate and convoluted
                  caps. Valner employs traditional glass-making techniques to
                  create these functional objects. (cat. xx, PTL-24650-59) Their
                  glass surfaces simulate the variable and complex colors
                  observed on fungal bodies found in the damp recesses beneath
                  our feet. Meanwhile, Front’s <em>Curve Lamps</em> &lt;insert
                  link to object page&gt; appear to grow and adapt to their
                  surroundings. The lamps reimagine the iconic green-glass
                  banker’s lamps with a contemporary twist. Emerging from small
                  yet sturdy bases, the lamps stretch and bend upward like a
                  plant or mushroom sprouting from the forest floor, seeking the
                  nourishing rays of the sun.

                  Andrés Reisinger and Júlia Esqué’s
                  <em>Hortensia Armchair</em> is an exuberant interpretation of
                  hydrangea flowers in bloom. (cat. xx, PTL-24649 and
                  PTL-24649.2) Initially conceived as a digital piece of
                  furniture by Reisinger, the chair was brought to life with
                  Esqué, a textile designer. Upholstered with over 30,000
                  laser-cut pink polyester petals, the limited-edition chair
                  evokes the feeling of sitting in a blooming flower. Fernando
                  and Humberto Campana’s <em>Bulbo</em> conjures the mysterious
                  tropical flora of the brothers’ native Brazil. The layered
                  petals of the flower-shaped seat gently cradle the sitter to
                  provide a feeling of security and tranquility.

                  Crafted by master glass blowers, Andreea Avram Rusu’s
                  <em>Botanica Chandelier</em> resemble the weighty and
                  sculptural blossoms of banana plants in milky pastel hues.
                  (cat. xx, PTL-24735) The surreal composition—the large,
                  pendulous flowers and a series of overlapping leaves suspended
                  from stems wrapped with leather—dynamically respond to the
                  interplay of surrounding light. While Avram Rusu expresses her
                  fascination with plant life in glass form, the lush banana
                  fronds of PELLE’s eye-catching
                  <em>Nana Lure Chandelier</em> are made of cast-cotton paper.
                  (cat. xx, PTL-24672) Illuminated from their undersides, the
                  large, elongated leaves are sculpted and painted by hand. Each
                  leaf is depicted with the accuracy of a botanical
                  illustration, from the prominent vein that runs their length
                  to the gentle wave-like pattern of their weathered edges.

                  Marc Fish’s <em>Ethereal Double Console</em> is made of
                  paper-thin veneers of sycamore, which are laminated and
                  manipulated into organic twists and curves and held together
                  with translucent resin.(cat. xx, PTL-24736×3) By preserving
                  the order of the veneers as they would be in the tree, the
                  console appears as if the wood itself has grown into its
                  shape. The innovative results resemble the lacy translucency
                  of a skeletal leaf.

                  Fredrikson Stallard’s <em>Species 1</em> expresses the chaotic
                  energy of the earth’s geological processes. (cat. xx,
                  PTL-24660, front and back) Made from a block of polyurethane
                  foam, the hand-carved sofa appears to have been shaped by
                  natural phenomena such as tectonic movements and erosion over
                  an immense period of time. <em>Species 1</em> suggests natural
                  places to perch or recline, yet it resists mirroring the human
                  body. Only when activated by a sitter does the functionality
                  of the sofa’s form emerge. Similarly, their
                  <em>Rock 22</em> and <em>Rock 23</em> appear to be minerals
                  extracted from the earth’s surface but are, in fact, remnants
                  from the production of the <em>Species</em> series. Supported
                  by steel mounts, the sculptural objects resemble rock, mineral
                  or meteorite specimens in a natural history museum or a
                  cabinet of curiosities.

                <p>
                  Patterns are a fundamental aspect of the natural world, and
                  they can take on a wide range of forms, from the highly
                  visible and repetitive to the subtle and chaotic. These
                  patterns often emerge as a result of natural processes,
                  physical laws, and interactions among various elements in the
                  environment, but not all are visible to the naked eye. They
                  often require microscopes, mathematical models, and
                  visualizations for us to observe and understand them.
                  Architects and designers often find inspiration in these
                  diverse patterns to create visually captivating and
                  conceptually profound structures.

                  In his renowned book from 1979,
                  <em>The Sense of Order,</em> Austrian art historian Ernst
                  Gombrich delves into the psychological aspects of human

                  Gombrich seeks to unravel the underlying reasons behind our
                  fascination with and inclination towards order, symmetry, and
                  geometric patterns in artistic expressions throughout various
                  cultures and historical periods. He argues that the human mind
                  possesses an inherent “sense of order,” which drives our
                  artistic creativity and preferences. This sense of order can
                  be traced back to our evolutionary history, where the ability
                  to identify patterns and regularities in the environment
                  conferred survival advantages. As a result, the human brain
                  developed a natural affinity for finding and creating order in
                  the chaotic world. It is not just a study of art and
                  aesthetics but an exploration of human psychology and
                  cognition. By understanding the psychological foundations of
                  our appreciation for order and symmetry, Gombrich sheds light
                  on the fundamental aspects of human behavior and culture.

                  Fractals, in particular, seem to capture the human
                  imagination. A term coined in 1975 by the mathematician Benoit
                  Mandelbrot, fractals have effectively quantified the intricate
                  underlying patterns found in many natural objects.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn4" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Fractals are infinitely complex patterns, or mathematical
                  forms, that exhibit self-similarity across different scales.
                  When we look at a fractal, we often see intricate, repetitive
                  patterns that continue to appear at different scales.
                  Mandelbrot argued that fractals and fractal-like patterns that
                  emerge during natural growth processes can be found in various
                  natural phenomena, ranging from the micro- to the macroscale.
                  These include vein patterns in leaves, the branching structure
                  of trees, mountain ranges, river networks, coastlines, waves,
                  and even cloud formations. The examples are nearly limitless.
                  Described as both the “fingerprint of nature”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn5" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                  fractal patterns and forms have captured the imaginations of
                  scientists and artists alike.

                  Fractals, among other geometrical patterns, have been proven
                  to reduce physiological and emotional stress in humans,
                  playing a significant role in evolutionary aesthetics and
                  environmental psychology.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn7" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Research consistently demonstrates correlations between
                  fractal dimensions in nature and those in architecture, art,
                  and design.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn8" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  As humans, we display a consistent aesthetic preference for
                  fractal images, whether or not these images are generated by
                  nature’s processes, mathematical equations, or the human
                  creativity.

                  Fashion design collective threeASFOUR’s collection,
                  <em>Human Plant</em>, explores the beauty and complexity of
                  fractal-like structures found within the plant world. (cats.
                  xx–xx, PTL-24455.1-3, PTL24456A-B, PTL 24457A-B) Employing
                  laser cutting, pleating, and other techniques, the studio
                  creates exquisite plantlike details and textures. Patterns
                  based on the complex network of leaf veins that branch and
                  intersect are printed on skirts, pants, and jackets that wrap
                  the body, such as <em>Autumn Leaf Suit</em>. Cut-out dresses,
                  including <em>Eve Dress</em>, are assembled piece by piece out
                  of components that mimic the intricate network of veins found
                  in some leaves. The parts are laser cut, seemingly leaving
                  behind only the leaves’ structural support. Another ensemble,
                  <em>Lily Dress</em>, captures the aquatic plant’s distinctive
                  circular leaves that rest on the water’s surface. The
                  collection beautifully evokes the harmonious geometries of
                  nature’s abundant foliage. By magnifying these diminutive
                  patterns and distinct structures, threeASFOUR establishes an
                  intimate connection between these geometries and the human
                  body. Ultimately, <em>Human Plant</em> prompts us to look more
                  closely and cherish the mesmerizing details that govern
                  nature’s beauty that often go unnoticed by the human eye.

                  Within the densely packed urban fabric of Seville, Spain,
                  stands <em>Metropol Parasol</em>, a massive
                  one-hundred-foot-high undulating structure designed by
                  Berlin-based architecture firm J. MAYER H. (cat. xx,
                  EXRR.2023.43.1) <em>Metropol</em>’s six large timber columns
                  rise from a concrete base to form a dendritic-like canopy that
                  provides shade for the city’s historic Plaza de la
                  Encarnación. The parasols are constructed from an interweaving
                  waffle-like timber lattice that creates continuously shifting
                  shadows throughout the day. (figs. xx and xx, EXRR.2023.86,
                  EXRR.2023.43.2) The structure creates a distinctive public
                  space that offers shelter and areas to gather and evokes the
                  sense of being under a forest canopy. Its public, open-air
                  spaces feature permeable boundaries and provide spatial
                  freedom reminiscent of nature while fostering a distinct sense
                  of place within the city’s dense historic center. By employing
                  tree, or mushroom, metaphors architecturally,
                  <em>Metropol Parasol</em> achieves a dual purpose: expressing
                  a lamentation for nature’s absence and symbolically inserting
                  its presence. (cat. xx, PTL-24705A-B)

                  Besides the wonders of plant structures, another remarkable,
                  clearly visible manifestation of fractals is the ocean and its
                  complex types of waves.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn9" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Mathieu Lehanneur’s <em>Ocean Memories</em> captures the
                  ripples and shimmers of ocean waves in fixed form. (cat. xx,
                  PTL-24689 second view) The collection of tables, benches, and
                  stools resembles the captivating surface of the ocean and
                  demonstrates how modern technology can be harnessed to mimic
                  the fluid dynamics of waves as they rise and fall. Lehanneur
                  and his team employed 3-D special effects software typically
                  used by the film industry to reproduce the complex geometry
                  and movement of water into digital forms. Blocks of marble
                  were then machine cut to replicate the digitally created
                  patterns, before being hand polished to a glossy, liquid-like
                  finish to create a surface that is as reflective as the ocean.
                  <em>Ocean Memories</em> captures a surrealistic vision of an
                  ocean frozen in time, reminding us of the immense power and
                  beauty of nature.

                  Iris van Herpen’s collection, <em>Sensory Seas,</em> dives
                  into the fibrous marine ecology that thrives deep within the
                  ocean. (cat. xx, PTL-24721) Suggesting the intricate and
                  organic structures found in the mysterious regions of our
                  aquatic environments, the <em>Diatom Gown</em> features
                  translucent cellular patterns of what could be described as
                  the exoskeletons of microalgae. Inky blues and greens are
                  printed onto sheer silk organza and layered organically,
                  forming a sea of fibrous structures. The dress evokes the ebb
                  and flow often associated with underwater life. (fig. xx,
                  embedded video, EXRR TK) With its fluttering fabrics, use of
                  color, and fantastic pattern, the dress holds a microscope
                  above the ethereal marine world and the mesmerizing

                  In today’s computational world, architects and designers often
                  utilize generative design approaches that leverage algorithms,
                  simulations, and iterative processes to simulate complex
                  biological phenomena or physical occurrences found in the
                  natural world. In the latter part of the twentieth century,
                  the quest to replicate nature’s creative code took an
                  astounding new turn. The simulation of nature’s almost
                  inexpressible patterns became possible through emerging
                  computational technologies, such as generative, parametric,
                  and algorithmic design tools. Geometries that were once
                  extremely challenging or even impossible to fabricate are now
                  realized with advanced computer-assisted production methods
                  known as digital fabrication.

                  In his 1999 book <em>Animate Form,</em> architect and designer
                  Greg Lynn explains his morphogenetic methodology, which
                  leverages computational tools and digital technologies to
                  create dynamic, adaptive, and generative forms.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn10" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  Lynn later applied this methodology to design a set of
                  flatware for the Italian kitchenware company Alessi. (cat. xx,
                  PTL-24369.1-5) Instead of starting with the spoon, from which
                  Alessi would alter to create forks and knives, Lynn initiated
                  the process by designing a primitive, yet-to-be-specified,
                  beginning, or “seed,” for the set: a bundle of tines as a
                  handle with webbing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn11" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  (fig. xx, EXRR.2022.264) This initial form served as a kind of
                  DNA code capable of generating an infinite array of utensils.
                  “How do we design a generic starting point which is latent
                  with all of that information that needs to unfold, which lets
                  us make all of the components or all of the elements in the
                  set part of this continuous family,” Lynn wondered.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-fn12" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  To achieve this, Lynn employed animation software, originally
                  developed for the animated film industry, where the primitive
                  form was combined and recombined in numerous ways,
                  facilitating a wide range of configurations and variations for
                  specific functions. (fig. xx, EXRR.2022.265) Each individual
                  utensil was articulated figuratively to reflect its specific
                  function. At once familiar and uniquely strange, the resulting
                  utensils are individually specialized yet collectively related
                  as a family.

                  Designers Joris Laarman and Nervous System explore generative
                  and parametric design processes. These approaches employ input
                  parameters and constraints to advance a design towards a
                  desired outcome, like an evolutionary process. Laarman’s
                  <em>Bone Chair</em> marked his first foray into using natural
                  science to determine not only the formal appearance of an
                  object but also the underlying structural logic that governs
                  its engineering and construction. (fig. xx, EXRR.2023.87)
                  Laarman’s <em>Adaptation Chair</em>, from the
                  <em>Microstructures</em> series, draws on the complex patterns
                  of growing branches and roots to adjust its geometry. (cat.
                  xx, 2015.263) Laarman engineered the chair starting from the
                  smallest structural and functional unit, or “cell,” imitating
                  nature’s approach of creating the most efficient structures
                  possible. The chair’s legs appear to organically rise from the
                  ground like a tree, redistributing their mass at specific
                  points in response to physical stress. As the legs grow into
                  branches, they fan out into increasingly smaller branches that
                  eventually form and support the seat and back of the chair,
                  akin to how a tree’s branches support its leaf canopy (trees
                  can add material where strength is needed). The final design
                  simulates cellular structures to meet the needs of different
                  areas of the chair. Each component of the chair is essential
                  to the whole.

                  Nervous System is a generative design studio founded by
                  Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg that creates
                  products inspired by natural phenomena. Using advanced
                  computer algorithms, the studio generates designs that mimic
                  patterns found in nature. The <em>Floraform Chandelier</em> is
                  an undulating flower-like surface composed of ten branching

                  by two generative algorithms created by Nervous System:
                  Floraform and Hyphae. Floraform explores surface development
                  through differential growth inspired by the biomechanics of
                  growing leaves and blooming flowers. Hyphae is an iterative
                  branching system based on how veins form in leaves. &lt;link

                  appears to have been extracted from the natural world;
                  however, upon closer inspection, the intricate blooms take on
                  a synthetic appearance, blurring the boundary between the real
                  and the hyperdigital. (cat. xx, TL-45469A installation photo)
                  When visitors engage with the installation, their images are

                  Manferdini’s digital garden immerses the visitor in a sense of
                  natural order taken to an extreme. Manferdini’s interchange

                      The striking vessels in Sandra Davolio’s
                      <em>Coral Flowers</em> series can take the
                      Copenhagen-based ceramist weeks to finish, due to the
                      complexity and delicacy of their form and material. To
                      create their signature shapes, Davolio first throws a
                      simple interior vase or vessel on a wheel, then applies
                      concentric layers of wet porcelain to the outside. Working
                      by hand, Davolio pinches and ruffles the porcelain into
                      thin, almost translucent ridges that bear resemblance to
                      the series’ namesake and inspiration: oceanic coral reefs.
                      <em>Coral Flower IV</em> is made of frit porcelain, an
                      extremely malleable type of porcelain which contains
                      granules of crushed quartz and alkaline glass frit. These
                      inclusions give the vessel a matte texture that appears
                      gritty in some areas, recalling the feeling of shells and
                      coral picked off a sandy beach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In addition to the sea, Davolio has also long been
                      inspired by art and objects from ancient Mediterranean
                      cultures, including Greek, Roman, and Etruscan. The pure
                      white porcelain of <em>Coral Flower IV</em> seems to glow
                      from within, evoking the same luminosity as classical
                      marble sculpture. This association is sadly appropriate on
                      another level: although classical sculptures’ pristine
                      whiteness has become synonymous with romantic
                      misconceptions of antiquity, the sculptures were
                      originally brightly painted. Time and environmental
                      factors have degraded the colorful surfaces; in parallel,
                      coral becomes white, or bleached, as a stress response. If
                      the stressful changes in the environment, especially the
                      fluctuating ocean temperatures caused by climate change,
                      continue, bleached coral eventually dies. Between 2014 and
                      2017, more than 75 percent of the earth’s tropical reefs
                      experienced bleaching.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-a-fn1" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-a-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                      Davolio’s meticulously crafted vessels, like
                      <em>Coral Flower IV</em>, are a monument to the beauty and
                      fragility of these vital ecosystems.

                      tree grows in accordance with mathematical and cellular
                      systems. A single bloom is the result of thousands of
                      cells dividing and multiplying, subtly adjusting their
                      trajectories in response to stimuli such as light and
                      temperature, to create something unique from a shared
                      process. These two works by Dutch designer Joris Laarman,
                      founder of Joris Laarman Lab, and the American design
                      studio Nervous System translate those formulas of growth
                      into objects that combine design, technology, and natural
                      forms.

                    <p>
                      Laarman’s shimmering copper
                      <em>Microstructures Adaptation Chair</em>, also referred
                      to as the <em>Long Cell Chair</em>, features branch-like
                      legs and a seat made of interconnecting loops. Light
                      filters through the open spaces in the seat like it might
                      through a leafy canopy. The chair’s organic structure
                      reflects the design process, which stemmed from a singular
                      base component: a vertical “long cell.” These cells
                      stretch, compress, and subdivide from the foundational
                      support of the legs to the concentrated structure needed
                      for the seat, in the same way a tree changes from a wide
                      trunk to smaller branches to individual leaves. (figs. 1
                      and 2—EXRR.2023.32 and EXRR2023.33) Nervous System also
                      looked to the plant world for their
                      <em>Floraform Chandelier.</em> Cofounders Jessica
                      Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg, who met while
                      studying at MIT, were inspired by the growth of blooming
                      flowers for the chandelier’s lightweight, ruffling shape
                      and leaf veins for the delicate filaments of the nylon
                      shade. Spanning over three and a half feet, the chandelier
                      produces intricate and dramatic shadows that pattern
                      surrounding walls and viewers with botanical forms. (figs.
                      3 and 4–2022.57.5 and 2022.57.4)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While these objects are influenced by the biosphere,
                      neither would have been possible without advanced
                      technology. Both
                      <em>Microstructures Adaptation Chair</em> and
                      <em>Floraform Chandelier</em> were developed from complex
                      software and then fabricated with an additive 3-D-printing
                      process. Laarman and Nervous System created unique
                      algorithms based on the differential growth of plants,
                      where certain parts of the cellular structure grow more or
                      differently than others; rather than environmental
                      factors, the designers manipulated the objects’ growth and
                      shape through mathematical inputs. (fig. 5–EXRR.2023.89)
                      Nervous System explained their process: “We consider this
                      work a kind of digital gardening, except instead of
                      growing plants we’re cultivating algorithms.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-b-fn1" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-b-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                      Similarly, Laarman describes his
                      <em>Microstructures Adaptation Chair</em> as “more like an
                      organism instead of an industrial design.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-b-fn2" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-b-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                      The comparable technical processes resulted in very
                      different appearances and functions for these two objects,
                      mirroring the diversity found within the natural world.

                      Architect and designer Elena Manferdini believes people
                      are drawn to nature not by its pure beauty or arcadian
                      symbolism but because it is a system made of recognizable
                      patterns. In 1975, mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot coined
                      the term <em>fractal</em> to describe the seemingly rough
                      and irregular patterns found throughout nature, from the
                      geographic features of coastlines and rivers to the
                      minutiae of plant cells. Around the same time Mandelbrot
                      was proposing theories of pattern in nature and geometry,
                      art historian Ernst Gombrich was investigating patterns in
                      decorative arts. He argued that symmetry and order in
                      design stem from a biological impulse to find predictable
                      rhythms in complex environments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-c-fn1" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-c-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                      Recent science has supported that the human brain is
                      uniquely drawn to these types of patterns, and over the
                      last fifteen years researchers have found correlations
                      between fractals, especially those found in nature, and
                      stress reduction in study participants.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-c-fn2" id="page-section-1-natural-analogs-entry-c-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This attraction to pattern becomes uncanny in Manferdini’s
                      hyperdigital reinterpretations of natural systems. From a
                      distance, the multimedia installation
                      <em>Wall Flowers: Clover</em> appears to be a lush expanse
                      of floral wallpaper, as our brains fill in the expected
                      pattern. Close looking destabilizes this impression,
                      revealing globular and wildly colored blooms that
                      intersect and intertwine in impossible ways. To generate
                      the imagery, Manferdini designed a 3-D-modeled animation
                      of a virtual meadow, swaying gently in a computerized
                      breeze. (fig. 1—EXRR.2023.90) Stills, each captured at
                      different moments, scales, and densities, are reproduced
                      on the wallpaper and three mirrored panels. The mirrors
                      simultaneously reflect and obscure the viewer as they move
                      through the digital flora. In the subtle variations of
                      time and dimension, the repetitions and cycles of the
                      program become apparent, creating a complex and dense
                      environment that is both appealing and incongruous, wild
                      and synthetic. Viewers are encouraged to photograph their
                      unique encounters with the work, a postcard from an
                      otherworldly landscape.

                  The effects of time in nature on humans’ well-being have been
                  thoroughly and scientifically investigated over the last few
                  decades, with documented results including decreases in
                  cortisol and heart rate. In Japan, people who spent time
                  walking through forests also reported feeling comfortable,
                  soothed, or refreshed afterward.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-1-kim-ruffin-guided-forest-walk-dam-intro-kr-approved-fn1" id="page-section-1-kim-ruffin-guided-forest-walk-dam-intro-kr-approved-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  For certified nature and forest therapy guide Kimberly Ruffin,
                  nature is also an experience of faith, which she defines in
                  this forest walk as “a continuous exchange of belonging.”

                <p>
                  This audio-guided walk is an invitation to engage your senses
                  and be present in your body and in place. While it’s called a
                  forest walk, it can be done in any outdoor setting, although
                  it should be a site that’s already familiar to you, such as a
                  favorite hiking trail, a city park, or even your own backyard.
                  Set aside about forty-five minutes for this experience, but
                  you can take more time if you’d like. When you are ready,
                  press play and let Kimberly guide you through nature and
                  reflection.

                  Natural systems describe nature’s processes and phenomena,
                  especially seasonal and temporal changes characteristic of a
                  healthy ecosystem, such as climate and weather patterns,
                  hydrology, and plant receptivity and cycles. Social ecologist
                  Stephen Kellert, whose research and writing advanced the
                  understanding of the connection between humans and the natural
                  world, pointed to biophilia as “the inherent human inclination
                  to affiliate with natural systems and processes, most
                  particularly life and life-like (e.g., ecosystems) features of
                  the nonhuman environment.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn1" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  There is limited, but growing, scientific documentation of the
                  health impacts associated with access to natural systems.
                  These systems, or at least their observable characteristics,
                  are believed to enhance positive health responses. Kellert
                  acknowledged that seeing and understanding the processes of
                  nature can create a perceptual shift in what’s being seen and
                  experienced.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn2" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  This relationship has a strong temporal element, which can be
                  expressed culturally. Japanese culture celebrates the
                  ephemerality of cherry blossoms, and in some Indigenous
                  cultures, the auroras—natural light displays in the earth’s
                  sky—are seen as the spirits of ancestors or celestial dancers.

                <p>
                  Over the past twenty years, technology has greatly reshaped
                  our world and our relationship to it. The proliferation of
                  technology, like the rapid advancements in artificial
                  intelligence, continues, distracting us from other
                  relationships, including our connection with natural systems.
                  But what if it could reconnect us instead? It is perhaps no
                  surprise that the use of cutting-edge technologies to manifest
                  the wonders of nature is burgeoning among contemporary artists
                  and designers who meditate on how humans and the natural world
                  are intricately intertwined and interdependent.

                  The following artworks go beyond making use of nature’s forms
                  or patterns to evoke the natural rhythms of life—the
                  fundamental exchange of energy between organisms and their
                  environments. These experiences, sometimes immersive or
                  interactive, create meaningful, direct connections with
                  natural processes and phenomena, particularly through movement
                  and multisensory interactions. They invite us to slow down,
                  pay attention, and trust what our bodies already understand.
                  They evoke a relationship to a greater whole, triggering a
                  deeper awareness of the nature of life and the sense of awe
                  and wonder we can experience being immersed in it. While they
                  are not a replacement for the real thing, these encounters can
                  cultivate surprise, delight, and even empathy. They may even
                  inspire stewardship of the ecosystems within which we all
                  exist.

                  Cofounded by artists Lonneke Gordijn and Ralph Nauta, the
                  Amsterdam-based multidisciplinary studio DRIFT creates
                  experiential sculptures, installations, and performances that
                  reawaken our connection to the natural world. DRIFT manifests
                  the phenomena and hidden properties of nature with the use of
                  technology to reestablish our connection to it. “DRIFT
                  reconnects people with nature through art,” according to
                  Nauta. “We create spaces where the viewer is tuned into
                  rhythms resembling natural movements such as the blossoming of
                  flowers, flocks of flying birds, and sea waves.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn3" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  DRIFT’s <em>Shylight</em> (fig. 1, EXRR.2023.92) and
                  <em>Meadow</em> examine how a man-made object can mirror and
                  amplify nature’s subtle wonders. (cat. xx, PTL-24706) The
                  kinetic installations feature mechanical flowers made from
                  layers of diaphanous silk, and integrated LED lights
                  illuminate them from within. (fig. 2, EXRR.2023.93) Suspended
                  from above, each fixture is programmed to mimic the nastic
                  movement &lt;insert link to glossary&gt; of blossoms that open
                  and close in reaction to changing light. <em>Shylight</em> and
                  <em>Meadow</em> emulate the biological behavior of nyctinasty
                  &lt;insert link to glossary&gt; but do not strictly copy it.
                  Going beyond mere imitation, DRIFT’s flowers are oversized,
                  and the speed of their movement is accelerated. The results
                  give the impression of experiencing the phenomena under a
                  magnifying glass and at a quickened pace.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Produced in 2006, <em>Shylight</em> features white flowers
                  that descend and unfurl to bloom above the viewer’s head,
                  before retreating upward and closing again. (fig. 3,
                  EXRR.2023.93 second view, embedded video) The installation’s
                  ethereal appearance contradicts the complex technical
                  components and custom software that took the studio years to
                  develop. <em>Shylight</em> feels alive due to its carefully
                  choregraphed movements that are based on natural human
                  rhythms, such as heartbeats and breathing. While the blossoms
                  in <em>Shylight</em> appear to move individually and
                  independently from one another, <em>Meadow</em> could be
                  understood as a single organism—an interconnected field of
                  colorful flowers that perpetually open and close in sequence.
                  <em>Meadow</em>’s rhythmic and persistent change awakens not
                  only the senses but also the imagination, as it delves into
                  the uncanny nature of a sentient environment. (fig. 4,
                  PTL-24706 second view, embedded video) We experience
                  <em>Meadow</em> more like we see ourselves: with character,
                  body language, and a collective story.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Meadow</em>’s fabric flowers are printed in gradient
                  shades that harmonize with colored LED lights to evoke the
                  changing tones of a skyscape as dawn transitions to dusk. Its
                  unique colors and ever-changing choreography imbue the artwork
                  with an organic beauty. According to DRIFT, the artwork is
                  “inspired by the impermanence of the ever-changing seasons,
                  the sensational character of natural growth processes, and the
                  insight that plant life often functions as a colony, rather
                  than as a group of individuals.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn4" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  <em>Meadow</em> evokes the ephemerality of nature and the
                  sense of awe that comes from being immersed in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although <em>Meadow</em> evokes nyctinasty, its choreography
                  can be described as a Heraclitean motion, a soft pattern of
                  movement associated with safety and comfort that “is always
                  changing but always remaining the same,” like waves lapping on
                  a shore or grass rippling in the breeze.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn5" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  As both a constantly changing light source and a field of
                  mechanical blossoms, <em>Meadow</em> captures our attention
                  effortlessly. The overall effect encourages “soft
                  fascination,” allowing the mind to relax and recover while
                  watching the hypnotic motion of the lamps.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn6" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  The cathartic, quiet pace of <em>Meadow</em> invites us to
                  collectively explore the complexities of the natural world.

                <p>
                  French multidisciplinary designer Mathieu Lehanneur combines
                  art, design, science, and technology in projects that
                  interpret natural systems and replicates them into
                  human-centered solutions that benefit society. Originally
                  conceived for the palliative care units at the Diaconesses
                  Croix Saint-Simon Hospital Group in Paris, Lehanneur’s
                  <em>Tomorrow Is Another Day</em> (<em>Demain est un Autre Jour</em>) generates a digital animation of tomorrow’s sky. Installed
                  on the wall of a patient’s room,
                  <em>Tomorrow Is Another Day</em> broadcasts a slowly and
                  continuously moving image of the atmosphere through its
                  circular screen. (cat. xx, PTL-24699 and second view) “It’s
                  not a video that plays the same images of the same sky over
                  and over again,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn7" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Lehanneur explains. The designer worked with a computer
                  programmer to create custom software that aggregates
                  meteorological and atmospheric data, such as the time of day,
                  color of the sky, speed and transparency of clouds, and
                  humidity, from the internet in real time to create an
                  animation of tomorrow’s sky. The aperture can be customized to
                  reflect specific locations, providing a sense of familiarity
                  and personalization.

                </figure>
                <p>
                  Lehanneur’s concept purposely fosters a profound therapeutic
                  and poetic experience for the patients who observe it, aiming
                  to reestablish their connection with the ever-changing weather
                  patterns of the natural world. According to Lehanneur, “There
                  were infinite variations of grays, cloudy silhouettes, and
                  light intensity that had to be reproduced. Paradoxically, it
                  was necessary to reach this level of sophistication so that

                  These vital aspects of nature often remain concealed from
                  patients and other individuals in healthcare facilities, yet
                  passive visual experiences hold the potential to offer
                  profound benefits through diverse encounters with nature.
                  Stress recovery theory (SRT) proposes that contact with
                  natural environments reduces the psychophysiological stress
                  level of individuals, while attention restoration theory (ART)
                  suggests that mental fatigue and concentration can be improved
                  by time spent in, or looking at, nature.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn9" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  <em>Tomorrow Is Another Day</em> not only captures these
                  elusive natural phenomena but also transforms them into
                  spiritual experiences for patients and their families. It
                  prompts contemplation on the concepts of permanence and
                  impermanence, the fundamental principles of uncertainty, and
                  spirituality. Ultimately, the artwork offers a unique
                  opportunity to transcend the confines of time itself.

                  London-based, Dutch artist Simon Heijdens reinterprets natural
                  processes with unique technologies, embedding them in man-made
                  surroundings to uncover the hidden essence of a place.
                  Meteorological conditions, including sunlight and wind, along
                  with custom algorithms and human interactions, dynamically
                  transform the artist’s responsive artworks in real time,
                  giving rise to ever-changing forms. Despite their technical
                  complexity, Heijdens’s installations possess a restrained and
                  poetic appearance, seamlessly integrated into their respective
                  settings. They provoke contemplation on the significance of
                  nature and coincidence in an increasingly developed world
                  while offering moments of exploration, wonder, and
                  introspection.

                <p>
                  Heijdens’s <em>Lightweeds</em> is a living digital organism
                  that reintroduces us to nature’s element of surprise. (cat.
                  xx, PTL-26101) These virtual plants grow indoors but depend
                  closely on actual rain and sunlight, swaying with the wind.
                  <em>Lightweeds</em> responds directly to the ever-changing
                  conditions of the outside world, as measured through sensors
                  placed on the exterior of the building. As people pass by, the
                  willowy weeds shudder and sway, eventually pollinating. Their
                  seeds trail passers-by before dispersing throughout the space.
                  With their continuous cycle of growth and decay, the plants’
                  location and density reveal insights into the way the building
                  is utilized.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Lightweeds</em> not only chronicles the passage of time
                  but also captures the evolution of the natural surroundings.
                  Generated from a specific locality and in a state of constant
                  flux, the digital projection introduces an element of chance
                  and time into the built environment. By doing so, it unveils
                  the natural processes and phenomena that are gradually
                  disappearing from our increasingly conditioned, static, and
                  climate-controlled urban lives. <em>Lightweeds</em> serves as
                  a visual reminder to reengage with the inherent beauty and
                  vitality of the natural world that surrounds us.

                  <em>Flowers and People—A Whole Year per Hour</em> addresses
                  the fleeting nature of the seasons and the interactional
                  relationship between humans and the natural world. (cat. xx,
                  PTL-25755 and 2nd view) The interactive digital artwork
                  vividly depicts a year’s worth of seasonal flowers that
                  continuously change. The flowers gradually and repeatedly
                  sprout, grow, bud, and blossom until their petals eventually
                  scatter and fade across the artwork’s multiple screens. The
                  cycles of growth and efflorescence within this digital garden
                  advance through spring, summer, fall, and winter at an
                  accelerated pace. As the title suggests, one year passes in
                  the span of an hour.

                  programmers, engineers, CG animators, mathematicians, and
                  architects who collaboratively navigate the confluence of art,
                  technology, design, and the natural world,
                  <em>Flowers and People</em> is generated by a computer program
                  that continuously presents the work, but the interaction
                  between people and the artwork causes continuous changes. When
                  people move in front of the screens, the flowers’ petals
                  scatter all at once. But when they stand still, flowers grow
                  and bloom more profusely. <em>Flowers and People</em>’s
                  surreal, yet sensuous, components form an artificial
                  ecosystem, gently flexing and responding to time and the
                  viewer, that can never be replicated. <em>People</em> become
                  active participants, cocreating and establishing collective
                  resonance.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn11" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  This approach casts visitors and their relationships to one
                  another as integral to the ultimate form of the
                  work—underscoring their collective presence as a positive
                  means of creation and serving as a metaphor for the integrated
                  systems of nature itself, where distinctive parts interact to
                  become a unified whole. (fig. 5, PTL-25755 embedded video)

                  Long fascinated by humans’ engagement with the natural world,
                  teamLab wants users to see in real time their impact on
                  nature. “We have given form to what we in the modern era
                  consider to be life,” teamLab explains. “Digital technology
                  has made it possible, more than any other man-made artifacts,
                  to express these subtle transformations and interactions that
                  nature has. It also has enabled us to create the expression
                  that gives us a deeper sense of unity with artworks. We think
                  this brings the viewers an opportunity to redefine the
                  relationship between nature and humans.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-fn12" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  <em>Flowers and People</em> heightens the participants’
                  awareness of the world they inhabit and can inspire a
                  reconsideration of their own impact upon shared ecosystems. In
                  an increasingly divisive world in which feelings of alienation
                  and isolation are replacing those of relationship and
                  community, such experiences are fundamental to our well-being.

                <p>
                  In an era dominated by technology and a growing disconnection
                  from nature, it is crucial to find ways to reconnect with the
                  natural world. The use of cutting-edge technologies in art and
                  design offers a unique opportunity to bridge this gap and
                  evoke a sense of wonder and awe through immersive experiences.
                  Artists and designers utilize technology to manifest the
                  beauty and intricacies of natural systems, reminding us of our
                  inherent connection to the environment. These artworks invite
                  us to slow down, pay attention, and engage with the rhythms of
                  life. By experiencing these digital representations of
                  nature’s systems and processes, we can cultivate a deeper
                  appreciation and understanding of the ecosystems that surround
                  us, fostering a sense of stewardship and inspiring positive
                  change. Through art, technology, and our own active
                  participation, we have the power to rekindle our relationship
                  with the natural world and forge a harmonious future.

                        (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1989). A
                        core premise of Rachel and Stephen Kaplan’s Attention
                        Restoration Theory (ART) suggests that mental fatigue
                        and concentration can be improved by time spent in, or
                        looking at, nature. There are certain types of
                        restorative experiences that seem to transcend others
                        and produce multiple benefits, not just the benefit of
                        escape from stress alone. One of these states is the
                        “soft fascination” that occurs when a person is immersed
                        in nature, a stimulus that initiates the use of
                        involuntary attention, or attention that requires no

                      In the spring and summer, vibrant fields of wildflowers
                      erupt across the Rocky Mountains. Although the high
                      altitude and volatile weather limit the variety of flowers
                      that can grow, each meadow is still unique, responding to
                      its environment and surrounding life with true site
                      specificity. This is also the case with Amsterdam-based
                      studio DRIFT’s <em>Meadow</em>, a kinetic sculpture of
                      massive fabric flowers suspended on armatures that open
                      and close hypnotically. These base components are never
                      the same twice: the flowers’ colors, arrangement, and
                      motion are influenced by locality just as much as their
                      natural counterparts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For the Denver Art Museum, the sweeping colors were
                      inspired by flora native to Colorado, including the iconic
                      columbine. The bright blues, yellows, and oranges of
                      alpine wildflowers are meticulously color matched and
                      printed on fabric, as well as translated to a digital
                      gradient of light that emanates from within each flower as
                      it opens. (fig. 1) This “choreography,” as DRIFT calls it,
                      is inspired not just by the surrounding natural landscape
                      but also by <em>Meadow</em>’s location within the built
                      environment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-a-fn1" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-a-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                      Between the sharp, angular walls of the museum’s Frederick
                      C. Hamilton Building, the cluster of oversized flowers
                      widens and intensifies as the space opens, as a mass of
                      mountain blooms might grow between two rocky outcroppings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Using custom robotics and complex software, the flowers in
                      <em>Meadow</em> replicate the motion of nyctinastic
                      plants, which close their petals at night and open in the
                      morning in response to the light and temperature of the
                      sun. As the colossal flowers open above visitors’ upturned
                      faces, viewers fulfill the sun’s role, becoming the
                      sustaining force of life for this ecosystem. Just as
                      <em>Meadow</em> flourishes between technological and
                      natural processes, experiencing its meditative rhythm
                      places us at the convergence of many different scales and
                      spaces, encouraging reflection on our roles in the world.

                      Weather is often labeled as small talk’s last resort, a
                      dreaded part of a conversation. However, it is also many
                      people’s closest and most direct engagement with the
                      rhythms and patterns of nature. This combined banality and
                      universality is what inspired multidisciplinary designer
                      Mathieu Lehanneur to evoke weather patterns in his project
                      <em>Tomorrow is Another Day</em> (<em>Demain est un Autre Jour</em>), commissioned and designed in 2011 for Diaconnesses
                      Croix Saint-Simon Hospital in Paris*.* The porthole-like
                      object glows softly as a honeycomb-structured screen
                      displays gently moving clouds and color-shifting skies: a
                      projection of the weather for the following day gathered
                      from real-time meteorological data. A screen, a sculpture,
                      and a celestial globe all in one,
                      <em>Tomorrow is Another Day</em> expresses the ethereal
                      and profound aspects of natural phenomena. (figs. 1 and 2)

                      Scientists and medical professionals have long been
                      interested in the benefits of nature, particularly natural
                      views, on hospital patients. In 1984, psychologist and
                      architect Roger Ulrich published a study that found
                      gallbladder-surgery patients who could see trees through
                      their windows were recorded as requesting less pain
                      medication and described by hospital staff as having
                      better attitudes than patients in rooms without green
                      views.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-b-fn1" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-b-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                      In an important distinction, however,
                      <em>Tomorrow is Another Day</em> was designed for a
                      palliative care unit, where patients face complex
                      illnesses, frequently with unfavorable prognoses. The
                      average duration of a stay is only twelve days.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-b-fn2" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-b-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                      Employees of the hospital noticed that patients and their
                      families often struggled for conversation, which Lehanneur
                      believed to be due to the uncertainty of terminal illness.
                      In seeing the next day’s weather patterns, which can be
                      programmed to any location in the world, patients and
                      their loved ones are reconnected to an idea of the future
                      and can visualize themselves in it.
                      <em>Tomorrow is Another Day</em> reaffirms the importance
                      of nature and its processes in the lives of people,
                      especially in difficult periods, through something as
                      mundane as experiencing—and talking about—the weather.

                      Art collective teamLab considers their work to exist
                      outside of boundaries. In form, it incorporates elements
                      of fine art, technology, immersive spectacle, and natural
                      imagery. More importantly to the artists, however, it
                      seeks to transverse the barriers that exist between people
                      and the natural world or each other. In
                      <em>Flowers and People—A Whole Year per Hour</em>, vibrant
                      blossoms erupt and fade across multiple screens.
                      Resembling illuminated paper cutouts, the flowers grow and
                      dissolve in response to programming that continuously
                      renders the imagery in response to real time actions of
                      visitors. As people spend time with the work, flowers
                      bloom abundantly in front of them; when they move away,
                      the petals scatter and disappear.
                      <em>Flowers and People</em> transforms through visitor
                      presence, expressing the fundamental effects of human
                      action on nature. In this case, humans are the catalyst
                      for beauty and growth, and their absence creates a void,
                      aligning with teamLab’s ultimate thematic goal to “create
                      an experience where the relationship between the world and
                      oneself is borderless and continuous.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-c-fn1" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-c-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The movement and colors of
                      <em>Flowers and People</em> become more dramatic as more
                      people interact with it, encouraging affiliation with the
                      actions of other viewers. By inspiring a sense of awe
                      through a community encounter, teamLab hopes that visitors
                      will begin to think of the presence of other people as
                      beautiful or beneficial, rather than a hindrance to one’s
                      own experience.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-c-fn2" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-c-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                      Recent scientific and psychological studies of awe suggest
                      that this could be correct: people who report feelings of
                      awe, wonder, or transcendence were recorded as behaving
                      more generously, being more curious, and wanting to
                      connect more with others afterward.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-c-fn3" id="page-section-2-natural-systems-entry-c-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                      It is fitting that both nouns in the title of the work are
                      plural: much like life itself,
                      <em>Flowers and People</em> is meant to be a shared event.

                  In the winter of 2019, Dacher Keltner visited his dying
                  younger brother. In his mid-50s, Rolf Keltner was losing his
                  battle with cancer. The older brother rested his hand on
                  Rolf’s shoulder. He sensed a light radiating from his brother,
                  a force around his body, pulling him away. He felt immense
                  sorrow but also the enormity of the mysteries of life and
                  death. In the presence of his brother and these immemorial
                  forces of time, he briefly lost his sense of being an embodied
                  individual.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn1" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keltner, a psychologist at the University of California,
                  Berkeley, later understood exactly what he’d experienced in
                  that moment: awe. Keltner had been studying this emotion for
                  years, usually in his lab, elicited in volunteers watching
                  videos of things like the Earth from space. But occasionally
                  Keltner and his colleagues would take subjects out into the
                  real world to stand under giant trees or raft in the
                  wilderness or look at dinosaur skeletons in a museum while
                  filling out questionnaires or offering up saliva to test
                  hormones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A child of a painter and a poet growing up in the ’60s,
                  Keltner was in some ways primed to study this emotion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn2" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Natural beauty was all around: Men were landing on the moon.
                  His neighbors in Topanga Canyon included some of the decade’s
                  most enduring musicians. Until Keltner was out of graduate
                  school, the emotion of awe had hardly been studied by
                  academics, even those who specialize in emotions. And yet,
                  argued Keltner, it lay at the very heart of what it means to
                  be human.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Closely linked to mysticism and other transcendental feelings,
                  awe has been shown to foster cooperation, humility, reverence,
                  caretaking, emotional wellbeing, and physical health.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn3" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>It may be the defining emotion of our species.</p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps it’s no coincidence that as so much in our world seems
                  to be teetering on the edge of instability—environmental
                  change, social fragmentation, technological distrust,
                  postpandemic malaise, anxiety, and disease—awe is enjoying
                  something of a moment. As scientific studies elevate the
                  status of this emotion, as more clinicians recommend it to
                  patients, as more people on their own seem to be craving
                  analog experiences and connections to each other, to art, and
                  to the natural world, awe is now, in some circles, touted as a
                  plausible and necessary corrective to despair.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But what exactly is awe? And why does it sometimes precipitate
                  dramatic mental and physical effects?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In attempting to define this somewhat ineffable emotion,
                  Keltner and fellow psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote a
                  groundbreaking paper on the topic in 2003. Titled “Approaching
                  Awe, a Moral, Spiritual, and Aesthetic Emotion,” it surveys
                  the writings of mystics, poets, and philosophers, including
                  Edmund Burke, who in 1757 described the sublime, in Keltner
                  and Haidt’s words, “as the feeling of expanded thought and
                  greatness of mind that is produced by literature, poetry,
                  painting and viewing landscapes.”
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn4" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The paper goes on to explain that people often feel awe in the
                  presence of vast natural features such as sweeping views,
                  mountains, storms, and oceans. But the authors noted that
                  “vastness” can refer to conceptual vastness as well, such as
                  quantum physics or evolution or any idea that blows your mind.
                  People can also feel awe in response to objects with infinite,
                  or just alluring, repetition, such as fractal patterns found
                  in forests, along coastlines, and in clouds formations.
                  Fractal patterns, according to mathematician Benoit
                  Mandelbrot, are patterns that repeat at different scales and
                  express some principals of unity, symmetry, and
                  self-similarity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn5" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  It’s no wonder that nature facilitates states of awe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But vastness is not the only ingredient. Awe requires
                  something of a double take. While encountering awe, we are
                  jolted—even momentarily—out of the ordinary. We may be a
                  little surprised, a little confused, certainly fully absorbed.
                  Keltner and Haidt conclude that a classic awe experience must
                  encompass two main components: a sense of vastness and a
                  little bit of mystery to the point that we seek to adjust our
                  mental maps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In his 2023 book,
                  <em>Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can
                    Transform Your Life</em>, Keltner expands on this earlier definition to include a
                  third component: a feeling that we are part of systems larger
                  than the self. This is ultimately what makes awe a
                  transcendent—and healing—emotion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To figure out how often people experience awe and under what
                  conditions, Keltner and colleagues gathered thousands of
                  narratives from twenty-six countries. They broke the results
                  into eight major categories of awe, or as Keltner puts it,
                  “wonders of life”:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Moral Beauty</strong>: People around the world are
                  most moved to awe by witnessing other people in acts of
                  courage, love, strength, kindness, and overcoming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Collective Effervescence</strong>: A phrase coined by
                  French sociologist Émile Durkheim, it refers to shared
                  experiences leading to an electric and powerful sense of “we,”
                  including weddings, funerals, political rallies, dancing,
                  singing, or marching together, and watching an eclipse in a
                  group, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Nature</strong>: Nature-elicited awe, such as from
                  viewing impressive features or encountering wildlife, accounts
                  for about a quarter of contemporary awe experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Music</strong>: Hearing music, playing music,
                  chanting, and singing can transport us, fill us with
                  vibrations, and make us feel connected to something beyond
                  ourselves through symbols and physical sensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Visual Design</strong>: From patterns to colors to
                  hallucinations to architectural grandeur, visual design can
                  open, in Aldous Huxley’s famous phrase, the “doors of
                  perception.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Spirituality and Religion</strong>: Whether through
                  dramatic conversions and visitation or simple meditative
                  practice, the very definition of spiritual means connecting
                  with forces larger than the self.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Life and Death</strong>: Few things move us as
                  profoundly as witnessing these fundamental and universal
                  passages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Epiphany</strong>: A classic feature of conceptual
                  awe, this is the moment we achieve insight or view an idea in
                  a wholly new way.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn6" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                <p>————</p>
                <p>
                  For those of us who love museums, it’s no wonder that visual
                  design and other sensory encounters can lead to feelings of
                  being transported outside the self. Museums can offer several
                  types of awe at once: Visual exhibits may incorporate music or
                  images of nature. Being surrounded by others creates a
                  collective experience. Perhaps we achieve new insight from
                  seeing emotions or ideas represented artistically. And large
                  sculptures and earthworks offer opportunities to encounter the
                  vastness of scale, not to mention the technical and creative
                  wonders of human ingenuity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consider the installation <em>Clay Houses</em> by Andy
                  Goldsworthy at the Glenstone Museum outside of Washington, DC.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The small stone cabins arise without fanfare alongside a
                  wooded trail. Handcrafted from small stones, they look like
                  something you might stumble upon on a desolate Scottish moor.
                  (fig. 1) From the outside, they appear the same: approximately
                  thirteen feet high, sixteen feet wide, and nineteen feet long,
                  topped by a simple pointed slate roof. You walk in through the
                  first cabin’s wooden door, and it takes your eyes a moment to
                  adjust to the dark interior. You might let out a small squeal
                  of delight or surprise as your eyes settle on a large
                  perfectly round earthen orb in the middle of the otherwise
                  empty room. (fig. 2) The orb is much larger than the doorway,
                  substantially taller than a person, cracked and slightly
                  desiccated. How did it get here? Why doesn’t it crumble?
                  Further investigation reveals that it’s made of brown clay
                  from the site mixed with horsehair, human hair, and sheep’s
                  wool. People around you take selfies in front of the orb as if
                  they have just emerged from a giant dirt bubble. You smile at
                  each other. The room is called simply <em>Boulder</em>.
                </p>
                <figure class="q-figure q-figure--group">
                  <div class="q-figure--group__row columns"></div>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  “What could possibly be in the next hut,” you wonder. This is
                  the artist’s intention. In his statement for the museum,
                  Goldsworthy wrote, “I don’t want to give anything away.
                  Finding the work inside is part of the sculpture’s nature. If
                  you let it be known they are art, it takes away from the
                  art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn7" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  And so you amble over to that entrance. Only a few people are
                  allowed in at one time. You step over the threshold. This room
                  contains no object. Titled <em>Room</em>, it is simply
                  plastered with the earthen material on every wall, ceiling,
                  and floor surface, giving the space an ancient, cave-like
                  quality. (fig. 3) It absorbs sound and light. Is it a house? A
                  mud-covered church? A gremlin’s secret lair? If it rains, will
                  it wash away? A stone exterior, a mud interior. It is unlike
                  anything you have ever seen. You stop to take it in, to
                  consider. In the stopping and sensing, there is a feeling of
                  alertness, and then peace. Time slows down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And finally: the third stone cottage. This one also contains
                  no object, but it holds another surprise. The small room’s
                  back wall recedes in a series of concentric circles that
                  telescope away from the viewer into a false rear wall. (fig.
                  4) The symmetry is perfect, but organic. Circles inside a
                  Euclidean room. The pleasing shapes are universal, mysterious,
                  and safe at the same time. This could be the site of a
                  primeval ritual, harkening back to a womb or a giant owl’s eye
                  or a cosmic wormhole. The room is titled <em>Holes</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You step out into the forest. You feel lighter. Amused.
                  Curious. Tender.
                </p>
                <p>But did you experience awe?</p>
                <p>Let’s break it down.</p>
                <p>
                  Did you experience a sense of surprise and the feeling that
                  this is something out of the ordinary? Decidedly so. What
                  about a sense of mystery? Probably so. Many questions likely
                  arose about both the artistic intention and the technical
                  fabrication. The rooms are made from mud, and yet while much
                  of Goldsworthy’s work is ephemeral, <em>Clay Houses</em> is
                  deceptively sturdy. On a deeper level, you may very well have
                  sensed the mystery behind the human desire to affiliate with
                  biophilic materials and the universal shapes represented. What
                  about vastness? In these rooms, you may have marveled at the
                  time required to hand build the stone structures and the
                  installations within. You may have even subconsciously
                  connected to a deeply evolved sense of human pleasure in these
                  shapes and materials, something that ties you by an invisible
                  thread to your ancient ancestors and to all people. The
                  installation speaks to time, to space, to collective memory.
                  In the presence of this art, perhaps you feel your individual
                  self to be slightly less significant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In case you’re wondering if similar experiences have led you
                  to a classic encounter with awe, researchers from the
                  University of Pennsylvania along with Italian colleagues
                  developed an “Awe Experience Scale” that encompasses six
                  domains.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn8" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  In it, viewers rate their responses to such statements as “I
                  noticed time slowing,” “I felt my sense of self was
                  diminished,” “I had the sense of being connected to
                  everything,” “I experienced something greater than myself,” “I
                  had goosebumps, or felt my jaw drop,” and “I felt challenged
                  to mentally process what I was experiencing.” You can add up
                  your scores and see how you fared.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s important to acknowledge, though, that not everyone
                  experiences awe in the same way. As individuals, we have
                  different capacities for awe, just as we have different
                  dispositions to feel optimism or fear.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn9" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Some of us are more jaded, less playful, less open to
                  mysteries, and less prone to having goosebumps or a tingly
                  feeling when encountering aesthetic stimuli. According to
                  research in the emerging field of neuroaesthetics, about half
                  of the population generates goosebumps in response to art and
                  poetry (nature, music, and other stimuli aren’t typically
                  measured).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn10" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  The personality trait most closely associated with this
                  tendency is openness, characterized by curiosity, exploration,
                  and comfort with novel experiences.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn11" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Several years ago, University of Utah psychologist Paula
                  Williams and colleagues made an interesting discovery. They
                  already knew that “aesthetic sensitivity,” i.e., the capacity
                  to be moved by beauty, is associated with prosocial
                  engagement, pro-environmental attitudes, and a sense of
                  connection to the living world. Using brain-imaging data from
                  the Human Connectome Project, Williams’s lab discovered that
                  people who responded positively to the goosebumps question
                  also show greater resting-state connectivity in the white
                  matter in their brains. They show strong neural connections
                  between the sensory-motor parts of their brains and the parts
                  that make up the default mode network, sometimes considered
                  the seat of the self.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn12" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  The goosebump people are also the ones who report being the
                  most resilient after stressful life events.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn13" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Williams was interested to know why. What was the relationship
                  between being awe prone and being resilient? The brain
                  connectivity itself could be part of the answer. People who
                  are moved by art appear to have an ability to take the sensory
                  stimulation—the chords of a sad song, the vastness of the
                  Milky Way, the pleasure of biophilia—and reflect on their own
                  lives and journeys. When we feel connected to our ancestors or
                  to living plants and animals, we feel less lonely. We gain
                  perspective on our problems. We feel the universality of our
                  plight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Experiencing awe through art amplifies our narrative
                  tendencies, enabling us to connect with the stories being
                  told. We become active participants, cocreating meaning and
                  finding personal resonance. We may find metaphors in the art
                  or build on the artist’s creation to tell ourselves stories
                  about our values, our own growth, or our place in a larger
                  world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The meaning-making theory sounds grand, but Williams has
                  another, more physiologically grounded explanation tied to the
                  slight discomfort we feel when we encounter a novel mystery.
                  The goosebumps themselves—similar to the raised hackles on a
                  dog’s back when facing danger—may be a mini version of a
                  threat response. When we experience something we don’t
                  understand, our nervous system pays close attention. Is this
                  safe? What is happening here? Think of sitting near the horn
                  section during a performance of Beethoven’s Symphony no. 5 in
                  C Minor. The second phrase of the first movement ends with a
                  climactic horn solo in which the sound wave vibrations enter
                  the listener’s body in a dramatic, unfamiliar, even unnerving
                  way. And yet, soon, the listener is wholly caught up in the
                  emotional height of the music followed by the resolution of
                  tension. It’s not an easy or mild experience. As the late
                  neurologist Oliver Sacks put it, “music can pierce the heart
                  directly.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn14" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Awe thrives in the face of mystery and the unknown.
                  Experiencing aesthetic awe in this way may be a sort of
                  practice for the stresses of life, argues Williams. “The term
                  I’ve come to use is that it’s a kind of stress inoculation,”
                  she says. “If you do it a lot, then you are always challenging
                  your system a bit and perhaps training yourself to have
                  comfort with novelty and things that are challenging.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn15" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>——————</p>
                <p>
                  Of course, not all awe makes us uncomfortable, or at least not
                  for long. Many things that are novel are also highly
                  pleasurable. Accordingly, there are other neurological and
                  endocrinological bases for why we feel good when we encounter
                  awe. One study indicated that while watching videos depicting
                  acts of moral courage, subjects produced more oxytocin, a
                  neurotransmitter linked to emotional bonding, a sense of unity
                  with others, and overall positive well-being.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn16" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Encounters with awe may also release dopamine and activate
                  reward networks in the brain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn17" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a paper published in the journal <em>Emotion</em> in 2015,
                  researchers in Keltner’s lab at UC Berkeley asked one hundred
                  undergraduates to fill out questionnaires assessing their
                  levels of different positive emotions such as amusement,
                  contentment, joy, pride, love, compassion, and awe.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn18" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  The subjects also supplied saliva samples to measure an
                  inflammatory cytokine called IL-6. Chronically elevated levels
                  of this molecule are associated with stress as well as
                  numerous illnesses including diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
                  and depression. In the study, those who recently experienced
                  awe had healthier levels of IL-6, and awe was the only
                  positive emotion predicting lower levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Neuroscience studies suggest that awe also quiets down
                  activation in the self-referential default mode network as we
                  either think less about our own dramas in moments of amazement
                  or we connect our problems in a more holistic way to the
                  external stimuli.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn19" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Real-world studies in the field confirm awe’s tendency to
                  diminish our egos. In one, researchers asked tourists at both
                  Fisherman’s Wharf (a commercial destination in the city of San
                  Francisco) and a scenic overlook at Yosemite National Park to
                  rate their experiences of awe and draw a picture of themselves
                  on graph paper. The Yosemite tourists experienced far more
                  awe, and they also drew their bodies as 33 percent smaller
                  than the urban tourists. They also wrote their signatures in
                  smaller penmanship.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn20" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>

                <p>
                  After the spectacular solar eclipse in the summer of 2017,
                  psychologists at the University of California, Irvine,
                  analyzed the language of seven million Tweets.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn21" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Tweets sent from the cone of totality used significantly more
                  universal words like “we” and fewer individual words like “I.”

                <p>Hermann Hesse said it well, if a bit verbosely, in 1926:</p>

                    [W]henever I experience part of nature, whether with my eyes
                    or another of the five senses, whenever I feel drawn in,
                    enchanted, opening myself momentarily to its existence and
                    epiphanies, that very moment allows me to forget the
                    avaricious, blind world of human need, and rather than
                    thinking of issuing orders, rather than acquiring or
                    exploiting, fighting or organizing, all I do that moment is
                    “wonder,” like Goethe, and not only does this wonderment
                    establish my brotherhood with him, other poets, and sages,
                    it also makes me a brother to those wondrous things I behold
                    and experience as the living world: butterflies and moths,
                    beetles, clouds, rivers and mountains, because while
                    wandering down the path of wonder, I briefly escape the
                    world of separation and enter the world of unity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn22" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>

                  Those feelings of noninvolvement, even when brief, are very
                  good for our mental health. In lab experiments that induce
                  awe, volunteers report a reduced awareness of day-to-day
                  stress and feelings of being less hassled. Either because of
                  improved moods or because of something particular to awe
                  itself, volunteers engage in more generous behaviors, for
                  example sharing money earned in computer games or folding more
                  paper cranes for tsunami victims.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn23" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>

                <p>
                  As Keltner puts it, “Awe is about as good for your mind and
                  body as anything. It reduces inflammation, so it’s good for
                  your immune system. It activates the vagus nerve, which is
                  good for your cardiovascular system. It’s good for your basic
                  digestive processes. And it’s good for your mind. Even ten
                  minutes of awe makes you feel less self-critical, less
                  stressed, less in pain, more creative, and more of just about
                  all the things we care about in the well-being
                  literature.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn24" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>

                <p>
                  It’s one thing to feel good in the moments during or right
                  after awe. But emerging science also suggests that awe may be
                  the primary mechanism by which people achieve long-term
                  improvements in symptoms of PTSD, in addictive behaviors, and
                  in feelings of fear around terminal illness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn25" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Nowhere are these results more apparent than around the
                  therapeutic use of psychedelics. In an extensive series of
                  case-controlled studies at Johns Hopkins Center for
                  Psychedelic &amp; Consciousness Research, where patients are
                  administered psilocybin (a derivative of “magic mushrooms”),
                  more than half of them report cessation of clinical symptoms a
                  year after treatment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn26" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  They also report enduring feelings of gratitude, life
                  satisfaction, humility, and well-being. In the high-dose
                  groups, most patients encounter a scientifically assessed
                  “mystical” experience, which is very similar to high scores on
                  the Awe Experience Scale. They see visual patterns, feel that
                  time is suspended, believe they are receiving epiphanic
                  truths, and experience feelings of unity together with a loss
                  of ego. It is, essentially, awe on Miracle-Gro.

                  In a 2018 paper in the
                  <em>International Review of Psychiatry</em>, Professor Peter
                  Hendricks of the University of Alabama speculates that intense
                  or “big” awe is transformative because it breaks down
                  established patterns and narratives of self-concept. What’s
                  left in their place are new valuations of the self and a
                  profound sense of belonging and connection. “For those
                  suffering from depression, end-of-life distress, or other
                  conditions marked by rumination,” writes Hendricks, “attention
                  diverted away from the self and toward the transcendent (e.g.,
                  family, community, the external universe, a belief system) is
                  likely experienced as liberating if not sublime.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn27" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Keltner and Haidt put in their 2003 paper, “awe-inducing
                  events may be one of the fastest and most powerful methods of
                  personal change and growth.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn28" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Awe researcher Michelle Shiota at Arizona State University
                  agrees, believing that awe opens a rare window of opportunity
                  to change our belief systems about the world and about
                  ourselves. In those moments of amazement, we can reconsider
                  everything we thought we knew. We can form new allegiances and
                  beliefs. But this isn’t always a good thing, she points out.
                  Cult leaders, religious figureheads, celebrities, and
                  politicians utilize the trappings of vastness and physical and
                  moral beauty to gain or indoctrinate new followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Shiota wrote in a 2021 paper, “Awe seems to produce a
                  little earthquake in the mind, a moment of cognitive
                  malleability offering a chance to expand and reconstruct one’s
                  mental model of the world. The model that emerges depends on
                  what happens in the moments during and after encountering the
                  awe stimulus. We still know far too little about that phase of
                  awe.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn29" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, she recommends we go out of our way to
                  experience awe, on our terms, often. “Keep your eyes open;
                  notice the unexpected,” she suggests. “Seek out new music,
                  literature, visual art, dance, or drama, and learn to
                  appreciate these art forms more deeply . . . the goal is to
                  deepen your understanding of the art form so that you
                  recognize the revolution, the extraordinary achievement, when
                  you encounter it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn30" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  If big awe can be transformative, what about small awe, the
                  kind we are more likely to run into on a regular basis?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many psychologists say yes. While grieving his brother,
                  Keltner sought out narratives of moral beauty, reading
                  biographies of Gandhi. He made an effort to regularly lose
                  himself in music, listening at home and occasionally attending
                  symphonies. Hofstra University PhD student and awe researcher
                  Marianna Graziosi sought relief over the death of a loved one
                  by watching her toddler niece play in the gentle surf of the
                  ocean.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn31" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  Michael Amster, a medical doctor and the coauthor of 2023’s
                  <em>The Power of Awe</em>, writes of resolving his depression
                  through finding small moments of natural beauty throughout the
                  day. He calls this practice “micro-dosing awe.” He now
                  prescribes daily awe to his patients suffering from mood
                  disorders and chronic pain**.**<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn32" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, says Amster, beauty is all around us. But we need to
                  pay attention and look for it. As Walt Whitman, the patron
                  saint of awe-seekers, wrote, “a leaf of grass is no less than
                  the journey-work of the stars.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn33" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we practice tuning into daily moments of beauty, we can
                  learn to get better at cultivating awe. At the same time,
                  we’ll be cultivating a more resilient mindset grounded in
                  curiosity, cognitive flexibility, mindfulness, and creativity,
                  says Utah’s Paula Williams.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn34" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once upon a time, it was easy to find awe. Our ancestors
                  looked up at the sky every night. They sat around a fire and
                  told stories of courage. They danced and sang together. They
                  regularly encountered wild animals. They searched for and
                  cherished fresh water and living plants. They worshipped and
                  contemplated cycles of nature. Our capacity to experience awe
                  no doubt helped our species survive, as it allowed individuals
                  to recover from stress. Moreover, it helped bond us to each
                  other to forge the cooperation necessary for our evolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If experiencing the sacred and the awesome are so good for us,
                  and so good for our social fabric, what does it mean that we
                  are living in a manner so disconnected from nature, and
                  increasingly, from face-to-face interactions?
                </p>
                <p>
                  It means this: the burden now falls upon art and culture to
                  help replace the daily awe we used to receive from the natural
                  world and from each other. While the Milky Way is now less
                  accessible, art has in some ways become more accessible than
                  ever before. Online platforms and virtual exhibitions allow
                  individuals from diverse backgrounds to encounter
                  awe-inspiring creations regardless of their geographical
                  location. The intersection of art and science has given rise
                  to awe-inspiring installations that merge aesthetics,
                  technology, and scientific principles. Viewers can experience
                  full-sensory immersive wonders that offer windows into the
                  mysteries of the universe and the complexity of ecological and
                  human systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a society, though, we need to keep improving access to the
                  arts. Opportunities to experience awe should be more equitably
                  distributed across race and class. To be our best human
                  civilization, we should be expanding arts education not
                  shrinking it. We should be teaching children how the natural
                  world works and allowing them to spend more time in outdoor
                  classrooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Encountering awe is central to the emotional and creative core
                  of being human.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Goethe once wrote, “I am here, that I may wonder.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn35" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Mary Oliver agreed, writing, “Let me / keep my mind on what

                  to be / astonished.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fn36" id="page-section-2-florence-williams-essay-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                  Popularized by the Chinese-born American geographer Yi-Fu Tuan
                  in 1974, the term <em>topophilia</em> &lt;link to glossary
                  term&gt; describes the affective bond between people and place
                  or physical environment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-fn1" id="page-section-3-topophilia-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Topophilia, Tuan wrote, “varies greatly in emotional range and
                  intensity,” such as fleeting visual pleasure, a sensual
                  connection that delights the senses, a fondness for that which
                  we call home, and joy on account of well-being and
                  vitality.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-fn2" id="page-section-3-topophilia-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Topophilia emphasizes our attachment to place and the symbolic
                  meanings that underlie this attachment. It encompasses both
                  the physical and psychological dimensions of our relationship
                  with the environment we live in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One powerful manifestation of topophilia is the connection
                  between individuals and their homeland. More than just a
                  physical location, homeland embodies a complex web of personal
                  and collective identities, cultural values, and historical
                  narratives. It frequently evokes a deeper set of attachments
                  than those predicated purely on the visual. The bond between
                  people and their native land is often forged through
                  generations, shaped by shared experiences, traditions, and a
                  sense of continuity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One’s homeland can act as a source of inspiration, shaping an
                  individual’s perception of themselves and the world around
                  them. It provides a sense of rootedness, a place where one
                  feels deeply connected, understood, and welcomed. The
                  connection to homeland nurtures a profound sense of
                  attachment, fostering a longing for the familiar and a desire
                  to protect and preserve the essence of one’s cultural and
                  geographical origins. It is a fundamental part of human
                  existence, contributing to a sense of identity and shaping our
                  relationship with the world. The following projects explore
                  the connection between people and places. Each reflects a
                  native ecology or landscape, conveys a distinct sense of one’s
                  culture or homeland, and supports a deeper understanding of
                  the multiple manifestations of biophilia.

                  A collaboration between Terrol Dew Johnson, a Tohono O’odham
                  artist and the New York- and Tucson-based design studio
                  Aranda\Lasch, the <em>Desert Paper</em> series embodies the
                  rich material history of the vast Sonoran Desert. (cats.
                  xx–xx, 2022.160, 2022.161, 2022.162) This unique ecosystem,
                  abundant with biologically diverse resources, has been
                  inhabited by Indigenous peoples for millennia and holds
                  significant cultural and historical importance to the Tohono
                  O’odham Nation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-fn3" id="page-section-3-topophilia-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  To create the paper baskets, Johnson gathers vegetation and
                  other natural materials, including agave fiber, copper,
                  creosote, jute, mesquite bark, volcanic rock, and wildflowers,
                  among others, that are endemic to the Sonoran Desert from
                  various locations around Tucson, and Sells, Arizona. (fig. xx,
                  EXRR.2023.94). Johnson skillfully combines these various
                  elements with a natural pulp paper, which is then carefully
                  draped over bent screens to form expressive and irregularly
                  shaped baskets. Each vessel in the series is a unique work of
                  art, characterized by its distinct texture, color, and
                  appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Desert Paper</em> celebrates the rugged, yet fragile,
                  beauty of the Sonoran Desert, the very landscape from which it
                  is created, while also honoring the profound human connections
                  to this environment. For Johnson, utilizing these regional and
                  culturally traditional materials is a way of reaffirming the
                  Native identity, specifically that of the Tohono O’odham
                  people, of these baskets, while forging a connection between
                  these experimentally shaped vessels and the ongoing tradition
                  of Native craft and knowledge-sharing.

                  The work of Santiago-based design collective gt2P (great
                  things to People) often reflects the natural landscapes of
                  their home country, Chile. Bordered by the majestic Andes
                  Mountains in the east and the vast Pacific Ocean in the west,
                  Chile lays claim to the second largest and most active chain
                  of volcanoes in the world. The
                  <em>Remolten N1: Revolution</em> series by gt2P pays homage to
                  Chile’s volcanic landscapes and celebrates nature’s ability to
                  create beauty through volcanic activity. (cat. xx, 2017.89-91)
                  With each eruption, magma emerges from the earth’s surface.
                  Molten lava transforms the existing terrain and cools to form
                  an entirely new landscape until the next eruption occurs.
                  Within the confines of their studio, gt2P replicates this
                  dynamic natural activity. The process begins with the
                  harvesting of basaltic andesite, a lightweight and porous
                  black rock, from Chile’s Osorno Volcano, located in the Andes
                  Mountain range roughly 650 miles south of Santiago. (figs. xx
                  and xx, EXRR2023.95 and 2^nd^ view) A landmark of the Los
                  Lagos region, the 8,700-foot-high snow-topped landform towers
                  over Todo los Santos and the shores of Llanquihue Lake. While
                  Osorno is one of the most active volcanoes of the southern
                  Chilean Andes, it has not erupted since 1869. Osorno’s
                  activity is dominantly effusive, with magma rising through its
                  surface and flowing out as viscous lava.

                </figure>
                <p>
                  After collecting the volcanic stone, gt2P grinds it into a
                  powder, applies it by hand to the surface of stoneware
                  structures, and then fires the objects in a kiln, treating the
                  volcanic powderas a ceramic glaze. Through extensive
                  experimentation, gt2P discovered that the melting points of
                  certain volcanic rock perfectly coincide with the firing
                  temperature of porcelain. This convergence enables the lava to
                  melt as the ceramic hardens within a specific temperature
                  range. By adjusting the firing process at various temperature
                  curves, they control the resulting colors, resistance, and
                  surface texture, yielding an array of unique objects such as
                  planters, side tables, stools, mirrors, and chairs. Each piece
                  showcases distinctive tactile characteristics, ranging from
                  smooth to dripped and rough finishes. (fig. xx, EXRR.2023.96,

                <p>
                  Imbued with emotion and the spirit of the natural world,
                  artist Alexandra Kehayoglou’s lush and tactile carpets depict
                  the disappearing and decimated ecosystems of her native
                  Argentina. Kehayoglou’s hand-tufted landscapes also draw
                  attention to the beauty and importance of safeguarding her
                  homeland’s fragile ecological resources. “If activism has the
                  task of ringing the alarm, art and design can offer ways to
                  connect us with something beyond. Something more spiritual,”
                  Kehayoglou explains. “We must hold on to hope . . . hope
                  offers a path forward.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-fn4" id="page-section-3-topophilia-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of Kehayoglou’s carpets examine Argentina’s
                  <em>pastizales,</em> or grasslands, a once vast and fertile
                  plain that covered a significant expanse of the country, from
                  the Atlantic Ocean to the Andes Mountains. Argentina’s
                  grasslands biome has been severely transformed by human
                  development, including the long-forgotten region buried
                  beneath bustling Buenos Aires. Kehayoglou began portraying the
                  pastizales as a way of recounting and acknowledging the past.
                  <em>Bajío</em> corresponds to a small fragment of the Paraná
                  Delta, an exceptionally biodiverse landscape in eastern
                  Argentina that lies near the country’s largest metropolitan
                  areas. (cat. xx, PTL-24707) The Paraná Delta faces
                  irreversible ecological change due to urban growth,
                  unsustainable agricultural practices, and the consequences of
                  climate change. The carpet is especially personal, as it
                  documents an island in the Paraná wetlands where Kehayoglou
                  lived with her family during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kehayoglou’s connection with her homeland, however, is both
                  natural—drawn from the landscape—and manmade, a product of her
                  family’s multigenerational manufacturing presence in
                  Argentina. Kehayoglou’s family has operated a factory that has

                  this way, her work represents the reciprocal dynamics of human
                  ecology theory. Both halves come together as Kehayoglou
                  recreates ephemeral native landscapes with a physical
                  manifestation of her family’s history. Tuan’s concept of
                  topophilia exemplifies the complex dynamic of Kehayoglou’s
                  artistic practice: “the affective bond between people and
                  place or setting. Diffuse as concept, vivid and concrete as
                  personal experience.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-fn5" id="page-section-3-topophilia-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                  Spanish artist and designer Nacho Carbonell’s
                  <em>One-Seater Concrete Tree</em> pays tribute to the
                  sun-soaked Mediterranean landscape of his childhood home.
                  (cat. xx, PTL-24710) Born in Spain, Carbonell spent his
                  formative years with his family in Valencia before moving to
                  Eindhoven in 2005 to pursue his studies. It was only after
                  leaving Valencia that Carbonell discovered the fundamental
                  role the region’s natural environment played in shaping his
                  identity. In response, Carbonell created a body of work that
                  explores his memories of the geography that defines his
                  previous home, from the picturesque Mediterranean coastline to
                  the rugged mountain ranges. Carbonell explains the influence
                  of these natural elements, “I just take them, and I
                  appropriate them because they are part of me, and I use them.
                  I feel entitled to say, ‘Okay, because we grew together, I can
                  use you in my work to create this narrative for others, to let
                  them know that you exist here.’”
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-fn6" id="page-section-3-topophilia-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                <p>
                  <em>One-Seater Concrete Tree</em> is a large-scale light
                  sculpture shaped as a sinuous tree. Its highly textured,
                  bulbous metal mesh canopy appears to have organically sprouted
                  from the rugged concrete seat designed for one person. Organic
                  and tactile, <em>One-Seater Concrete Tree</em> possesses a
                  vitality that suggests a living organism, achieved through
                  Carbonell’s use of various textures and man-made materials
                  such as metal mesh, steel, and concrete. As viewers take a
                  seat, the functional sculpture comes alive, arousing their
                  imagination and transporting them to the semiarid
                  Mediterranean landscape that Carbonell vividly remembers, or
                  perhaps triggering memories of their own. Carbonell clarifies,
                  “I want them to look at their own context, to open the door
                  and they are able to see that beauty exists in any other part
                  of the world. We only need to look outside.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-fn7" id="page-section-3-topophilia-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Ultimately, Carbonell’s artistic vision is an emotional
                  response to his own past, expressed through experimental forms
                  and materials. Drawing from his cherished memories of his
                  family home, he has created a tactile and functional
                  self-portrait, which serves as a physical manifestation of the
                  natural beauty that characterizes eastern Spain.

                  Located in downtown Denver, Studio Gang’s Populus evokes the
                  alluring features of a stand of aspen tress. (cat. xx,
                  EXRR2023.31.1 and EXRR.2023.31.2) The architecture firm’s
                  thirteen-story, 135,000-square-foot hotel takes its name from
                  <em>Populus tremuloides,</em> commonly known as quaking aspen,
                  which is the most widely distributed tree in North America and
                  an instantly recognizable symbol of Colorado. (fig. xx,
                  EXRR.2023.101) The texture and rhythm of the hotel’s
                  sculptural façade are strongly tied to its function. A series
                  of forty-six thin vertical scallops, each as wide as a typical
                  guest room, envelop the entire structure. A captivating array
                  of five distinctive window types, from dramatic ground level
                  arches to smaller openings, punctuate the hotel’s exterior
                  surface. (fig. xx, EXRR.2023.31.3) Their shapes are inspired
                  by the distinguishing patterns found on aspen trunks. As the
                  trees grow, they shed their lower branches, leaving behind
                  peculiar eye-shaped marks on their thin, papery bark. The
                  windows are also designed to respond to the interior spaces
                  and functions. Some rooms feature windowsills that integrate
                  seating or desks, while at the building’s base,
                  thirty-foot-high openings frame entrances and provide views
                  into public spaces. As Finnish architect Juhani Pallasmaa once
                  remarked, “Architecture is essentially an extension of nature
                  into the man-made realm.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-fn8" id="page-section-3-topophilia-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Studio Gang’s Populus captures the essential attributes of a

                  right in the heart of the city of Denver.

                  Completed in 2021, the Nanjing Zendai Himalayas Center by
                  Beijing-based MAD Architects, combines urban life with the
                  emotional resonance of <em>shan shui,</em> a traditional style
                  of Chinese landscape painting. Shan shui paintings often
                  depict misty mountains and flowing rivers with delicate
                  brushwork to convey a sense of tranquility and contemplation.
                  The goal of shan shui painting is not to create a realistic
                  representation but to capture the essence and spirit of the
                  natural world. It is not important whether the painted colors
                  and shapes look exactly like the real object.

                  Located in the capital of China’s eastern Jiangsu province,
                  the Nanjing Zendai Himalayas Center is a 138-acre urban
                  development consisting of commercial, hotel, office, and
                  residential spaces. (cat. xx, EXRR.2023.103, 2^nd^ view, and
                  3^rd^ view) The complex is made up of thirteen mountainous
                  towers intended to evoke a natural landscape. Placed along the
                  edge of the site, the lofty structures are delineated by their
                  vertical white glass fins that flow like waterfalls. The
                  development’s elevated vertical park features meandering
                  pathways that serve as an invitation for people to wander
                  among water features, gardens, and buildings. At the center of
                  the site is a village-like community of low buildings,
                  connected by footbridges and nestled into the landscape. By
                  bringing people up from the busy street level, MAD has created
                  an inviting landscape integrating the different elements.

                  The Nanjing Zendai Himalayas Center seeks to challenge the
                  prevailing typology of rectangular, homogenous, linear
                  structures that have shaped our urban environment. In
                  describing cities as “steel concrete forests,” Ma suggests
                  that our urban environments fail to match the thriving
                  ecosystem of a forest and argues that a forest requires a
                  state of symbiosis between every organism.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-fn9" id="page-section-3-topophilia-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>

                  In today’s increasingly urbanized and globalized world, the
                  concept of topophilia takes on renewed significance. As
                  individuals and communities become more disconnected from the
                  natural environment and uprooted from their traditional
                  homelands, the need for a sense of place and belonging grows
                  stronger. Topophilia offers a framework for understanding and
                  nurturing our emotional connection to the physical spaces we
                  inhabit. It reminds us of the profound impact that our
                  surroundings have on our well-being, identity, and sense of
                  rootedness. By exploring the diverse manifestations of
                  topophilia through art, design, and architecture, we can
                  foster a deeper appreciation for the places we call home and
                  cultivate a more sustainable and harmonious relationship with
                  our environment.

                        Historically, the Tohono O’odham inhabited an enormous
                        area of land in the Southwest, extending south to
                        Sonora, Mexico, north to central Arizona, west to the
                        Gulf of California, and east to the San Pedro River.
                        This land was known as the Papagueria, and it had been
                        home to the O’odham for thousands of years. Today, the
                        federally recognized Tohono O’odham Nation occupies 2.8
                        million acres of tribal land within the Sonoran Desert

                      after Aranda\Lasch founders Benjamin Aranda and Chris
                      Lasch saw Johnson’s work on view at the National Museum of
                      the American Indian in New York. At the time,
                      Aranda\Lasch’s process was primarily influenced by
                      algorithmic thinking, and they were intrigued by the
                      repetitive and generative process of basket weaving, as
                      well as the mastery achieved by weavers such as Johnson.
                      Early collaborations between Aranda\Lasch and Johnson
                      considered weaving algorithms literally, using computer
                      programming to generate structures that were executed with
                      traditional materials, resulting in baskets with
                      unexpected forms, such as a series of metal loops or
                      interlocking concave and convex planes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The baskets in the <em>Desert Paper</em> series are more
                      formally recognizable as vessels, but their unique
                      materiality creates unexpected textures and shapes. Formed
                      from paper created out of a slurry of desert matter and
                      natural pulps, the baskets appear delicate and lacey or
                      thin and rigid, with irregular and curling edges. This new
                      approach reflects Aranda\Lasch and Johnson’s shift in
                      focus from basket processes to functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Baskets both rely on and facilitate the exchange of
                      knowledge, combining physical and spiritual expressions of
                      utility, tradition, and symbolism. For the
                      <em>Desert Paper</em> series, Johnson gathered regionally
                      and culturally significant materials such as yucca,
                      wildflowers, creosote, agave, and stone from the Sonoran
                      Desert around Tucson and Sells, Arizona, the capital of
                      the Tohono O’odham Nation. These components remain visible
                      in the finished baskets: in <em>Desert Paper 02</em>, the
                      otherwise pale fibers are flecked with the vibrant pink of
                      globe mallow petals, and in <em>Desert Paper 09</em>, the
                      paper surface skims over creosote twigs. (figs. 1 and
                      2—2022.160.2 and 2022.162.2) To Johnson, the usage of
                      these traditional materials in experimental baskets is a
                      reaffirmation of Tohono O’odham identity. The place and
                      physicality of the Sonoran Desert is fundamentally
                      inseparable from the work, linking the baskets and their
                      weaver to a continuing tradition of Tohono O’odham craft
                      and knowledge sharing and rooting them firmly in a sacred
                      landscape.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-entry-a-fn1" id="page-section-3-topophilia-entry-a-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>

                    <p>
                      Alexandra Kehayoglou’s hand-tufted, textural rugs are slow
                      and intimate representations of history and landscape,
                      ranging in size from individual prayer rugs to carpeting
                      entire rooms. Kehayoglou considers her laborious and
                      precise weaving process a connection to an extensive
                      ancestral tradition, especially to her grandmother, who
                      immigrated to Buenos Aires from Isparta, in present-day
                      Turkey, with few possessions and a loom. Simultaneously,
                      the lush terrains of Kehayoglou’s textiles connect both
                      the artist and the viewer to nature in her translation of
                      topography, water, vegetation, and memory into tactile
                      piles of richly colored wool yarn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Many of Kehayoglou’s chosen landscapes are threatened by
                      economic and industrial pressures and exploitation, and
                      her rugs function as both a memorial and a call for
                      environmental awareness. One of her most monumental works
                      depicts the Santa Cruz River, Argentina’s last glacial
                      river and a sacred space for the Mapuche people, where two
                      hydroelectric dams are planned for construction. (fig. 1--
                      EXRR.2023.137) To become familiar with these landscapes
                      Kehayoglou embarks on extended research trips where she
                      takes photographs, makes sketches, and color matches yarn
                      samples.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-entry-b-fn1" id="page-section-3-topophilia-entry-b-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                      For 2023’s <em>Bajío</em>, the artist drew on a more
                      prolonged and encompassing type of research: Kehayoglou
                      and her family moved to a small island in the wetlands
                      during the COVID-19 pandemic. (fig. 2—TK) Immersed in the
                      landscape, Kehayoglou witnessed firsthand the ecological
                      disturbances in the region, as well as the perseverance of
                      nature. The specific area represented by
                      <em>Bajío</em> exemplifies this, as the river carries
                      seeds of plants from the denser northern wetlands,
                      depositing them into a changing landscape. The patches of
                      texture and color in <em>Bajío</em>, recreated in her
                      typical loving detail, can be viewed as a conversation
                      between Kehayoglou and the land, a process the artist
                      describes as “decipher[ing] those messages that would
                      allow us to transform unbearable loss into hope.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-entry-b-fn2" id="page-section-3-topophilia-entry-b-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Kehayoglou’s depictions of small and quotidian portions of
                      the wetlands emphasize their unexpected complexity and
                      beauty in what the artist considers a type of activism
                      which, like a rug itself, is “silent [and]
                      absorptive.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-entry-b-fn3" id="page-section-3-topophilia-entry-b-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                      For many people, the idea of a rug is rooted firmly in the
                      domestic sphere, an aspect of the home. Kehayoglou’s rugs
                      expand the home to encompass threatened places and
                      landscapes, a rejection of the separation between people
                      and nature and a call to treat the earth with the same
                      care and love as our own most treasured spaces.

                      For architect Jeanne Gang and her eponymous firm Studio
                      Gang, design and architecture should make cities better
                      places. This does not just apply to the cosmetic
                      alteration of a skyline but to a reduction of
                      environmental harm and a concrete improvement in the lives
                      of its users. Studio Gang calls this approach “actionable
                      idealism,” and it guides their research-based and
                      localized process.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-section-3-topophilia-entry-c-fn1" id="page-section-3-topophilia-entry-c-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In Denver, Studio Gang’s Populus hotel rises from a
                      triangular junction of three busy Denver streets. The
                      building’s bright façade and varied, oval-shaped windows
                      are a motif that is familiar for many Coloradans: they
                      resemble the white bark and dark “eyes” of aspen trees. On
                      an aspen, these characteristic marks are left behind as
                      the trees self-prune, shedding their lower branches to
                      expose more of the photosynthetic bark, which absorbs
                      light and energy year-round. For Populus, the eye-shaped
                      windows, the largest of which are thirty feet high,
                      accomplish the same effect, providing light, views, and,
                      for some hotel rooms, built-in seating. Extended “lids”
                      over each window redirect rainwater and create shade as an
                      efficient response to the harsh Denver climate; these
                      considerations of local and environmental impacts can also
                      be seen in the architects’ decision to have no onsite
                      parking, encouraging visitors to bike, use public transit,
                      or explore the neighborhood on foot.

                      Aesthetics are not the only similarity between the hotel
                      and aspens. A cluster of aspens seems to be made of many
                      individual trees (fig. 1-- EXRR.2023.102), but they are
                      all extensions of the same vast, underground root network,
                      a single part of a larger organism. In the same way,
                      Populus is informed by and will impact downtown Denver as
                      a whole, despite being just one building. By drawing on a
                      quintessential aspect of the regional environment, Studio
                      Gang designed the building to resonate with local
                      residents, adding retail, restaurants, and a public
                      rooftop garden and view deck to create opportunities for
                      connection and community. (fig. 2—EXRR.2023.31.5) While
                      Populus takes its name from an aspen’s scientific
                      classification, <em>Populus tremuloides</em>, the
                      homophone “populace”—the inhabitants of a designated
                      place—is also an apt moniker.

                    incidental notes to weigh it down, the blanket depicts a

                  <p>
                    I said we once formed kingdoms at the foot of a vanishing
                    stone.
                  </p>
                  <p>What was it I said that they said?</p>
                  <p>“Vividness is Self-Selecting”</p>
                  <p>several points flowing together in stonework.</p>
                  <p>I only use words like stones because we are far away.</p>
                  <p>
                    We corrupt a landscape through the planting of foreign
                    flowers.
                  </p>
                  <p>Borders are so often theorized as division</p>
                  <p>wending along with a spot of sunlight,</p>

                <p>“The bone frame was made for</p>

                  <p>No such shock, knit within terror</p>
                  <p>yet the skeleton stood up.”</p>

                    The marsh revels in its glitter and occasional cranberry.
                  </p>
                  <p>The subject is left purposely unstable,</p>
                  <p>we will not be robbed of continuum.</p>
                  <p>The shells fly out from the dress,</p>
                  <p>on strings, according to demands left in the music.</p>
                  <p>
                    Certain stories are told in full frog regalia, the music is
                    allowed its wet set of wings and room to lie down.
                  </p>
                  <p>Words arranged for prayer are in fact geometric forms</p>
                  <p>or portraits of poets themselves,</p>
                  <p>uncovering the dictates of a graven line.</p>
                  <p>
                    Orlando, are we even allowing ourselves the present moment
                    anymore?

                  <p>There are still two blankets that sit on either side</p>
                  <p>Reimagining can take place at the root of time,</p>
                  <p>out of all necessity</p>
                  <p>we convert the elements as a matter of course.</p>
