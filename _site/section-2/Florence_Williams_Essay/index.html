    <title>
      Big Nature, Big Art, and the Necessary Euphoria of Awe | Biophilia
    </title>

    <meta name="description" content="*Biophilia* is a term popularized by American biologist and author Edward O. Wilson to describe his theory that, as humans have evolved as a species, they have been intricately intertwined with the natural world. Wilson’s hypothesis invites deep reflection and poses relevant questions for audiences to consider life in our hyper-accelerated digital and urban-centric world. Organized by Darrin Alfred, Curator of Architecture and Design, Biophilia provides a space for leading architects, artists, and designers to re-examine and reanimate our intrinsic bond with the natural world. The exhibition features works by an international roster of designers and artists including Iris van Herpen, Studio Gang, teamLab, Joris Laarman and DRIFT, among others.">

                  In the winter of 2019, Dacher Keltner visited his dying
                  younger brother. In his mid-50s, Rolf Keltner was losing his
                  battle with cancer. The older brother rested his hand on
                  Rolf’s shoulder. He sensed a light radiating from his brother,
                  a force around his body, pulling him away. He felt immense
                  sorrow but also the enormity of the mysteries of life and
                  death. In the presence of his brother and these immemorial
                  forces of time, he briefly lost his sense of being an embodied
                  individual.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keltner, a psychologist at the University of California,
                  Berkeley, later understood exactly what he’d experienced in
                  that moment: awe. Keltner had been studying this emotion for
                  years, usually in his lab, elicited in volunteers watching
                  videos of things like the Earth from space. But occasionally
                  Keltner and his colleagues would take subjects out into the
                  real world to stand under giant trees or raft in the
                  wilderness or look at dinosaur skeletons in a museum while
                  filling out questionnaires or offering up saliva to test
                  hormones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A child of a painter and a poet growing up in the ’60s,
                  Keltner was in some ways primed to study this emotion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Natural beauty was all around: Men were landing on the moon.
                  His neighbors in Topanga Canyon included some of the decade’s
                  most enduring musicians. Until Keltner was out of graduate
                  school, the emotion of awe had hardly been studied by
                  academics, even those who specialize in emotions. And yet,
                  argued Keltner, it lay at the very heart of what it means to
                  be human.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Closely linked to mysticism and other transcendental feelings,
                  awe has been shown to foster cooperation, humility, reverence,
                  caretaking, emotional wellbeing, and physical health.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>It may be the defining emotion of our species.</p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps it’s no coincidence that as so much in our world seems
                  to be teetering on the edge of instability—environmental
                  change, social fragmentation, technological distrust,
                  postpandemic malaise, anxiety, and disease—awe is enjoying
                  something of a moment. As scientific studies elevate the
                  status of this emotion, as more clinicians recommend it to
                  patients, as more people on their own seem to be craving
                  analog experiences and connections to each other, to art, and
                  to the natural world, awe is now, in some circles, touted as a
                  plausible and necessary corrective to despair.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But what exactly is awe? And why does it sometimes precipitate
                  dramatic mental and physical effects?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In attempting to define this somewhat ineffable emotion,
                  Keltner and fellow psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote a
                  groundbreaking paper on the topic in 2003. Titled “Approaching
                  Awe, a Moral, Spiritual, and Aesthetic Emotion,” it surveys
                  the writings of mystics, poets, and philosophers, including
                  Edmund Burke, who in 1757 described the sublime, in Keltner
                  and Haidt’s words, “as the feeling of expanded thought and
                  greatness of mind that is produced by literature, poetry,
                  painting and viewing landscapes.”
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The paper goes on to explain that people often feel awe in the
                  presence of vast natural features such as sweeping views,
                  mountains, storms, and oceans. But the authors noted that
                  “vastness” can refer to conceptual vastness as well, such as
                  quantum physics or evolution or any idea that blows your mind.
                  People can also feel awe in response to objects with infinite,
                  or just alluring, repetition, such as fractal patterns found
                  in forests, along coastlines, and in clouds formations.
                  Fractal patterns, according to mathematician Benoit
                  Mandelbrot, are patterns that repeat at different scales and
                  express some principals of unity, symmetry, and
                  self-similarity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  It’s no wonder that nature facilitates states of awe.

                <p>
                  But vastness is not the only ingredient. Awe requires
                  something of a double take. While encountering awe, we are
                  jolted—even momentarily—out of the ordinary. We may be a
                  little surprised, a little confused, certainly fully absorbed.
                  Keltner and Haidt conclude that a classic awe experience must
                  encompass two main components: a sense of vastness and a
                  little bit of mystery to the point that we seek to adjust our
                  mental maps.

                  In his 2023 book,
                  <em>Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can
                    Transform Your Life</em>, Keltner expands on this earlier definition to include a
                  third component: a feeling that we are part of systems larger
                  than the self. This is ultimately what makes awe a
                  transcendent—and healing—emotion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To figure out how often people experience awe and under what
                  conditions, Keltner and colleagues gathered thousands of
                  narratives from twenty-six countries. They broke the results
                  into eight major categories of awe, or as Keltner puts it,
                  “wonders of life”:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Moral Beauty</strong>: People around the world are
                  most moved to awe by witnessing other people in acts of
                  courage, love, strength, kindness, and overcoming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Collective Effervescence</strong>: A phrase coined by
                  French sociologist Émile Durkheim, it refers to shared
                  experiences leading to an electric and powerful sense of “we,”
                  including weddings, funerals, political rallies, dancing,
                  singing, or marching together, and watching an eclipse in a
                  group, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Nature</strong>: Nature-elicited awe, such as from
                  viewing impressive features or encountering wildlife, accounts
                  for about a quarter of contemporary awe experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Music</strong>: Hearing music, playing music,
                  chanting, and singing can transport us, fill us with
                  vibrations, and make us feel connected to something beyond
                  ourselves through symbols and physical sensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Visual Design</strong>: From patterns to colors to
                  hallucinations to architectural grandeur, visual design can
                  open, in Aldous Huxley’s famous phrase, the “doors of
                  perception.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Spirituality and Religion</strong>: Whether through
                  dramatic conversions and visitation or simple meditative
                  practice, the very definition of spiritual means connecting
                  with forces larger than the self.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Life and Death</strong>: Few things move us as
                  profoundly as witnessing these fundamental and universal
                  passages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Epiphany</strong>: A classic feature of conceptual
                  awe, this is the moment we achieve insight or view an idea in
                  a wholly new way.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>————</p>
                <p>
                  For those of us who love museums, it’s no wonder that visual
                  design and other sensory encounters can lead to feelings of
                  being transported outside the self. Museums can offer several
                  types of awe at once: Visual exhibits may incorporate music or
                  images of nature. Being surrounded by others creates a
                  collective experience. Perhaps we achieve new insight from
                  seeing emotions or ideas represented artistically. And large
                  sculptures and earthworks offer opportunities to encounter the
                  vastness of scale, not to mention the technical and creative
                  wonders of human ingenuity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consider the installation <em>Clay Houses</em> by Andy
                  Goldsworthy at the Glenstone Museum outside of Washington, DC.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The small stone cabins arise without fanfare alongside a
                  wooded trail. Handcrafted from small stones, they look like
                  something you might stumble upon on a desolate Scottish moor.
                  (fig. 1) From the outside, they appear the same: approximately
                  thirteen feet high, sixteen feet wide, and nineteen feet long,
                  topped by a simple pointed slate roof. You walk in through the
                  first cabin’s wooden door, and it takes your eyes a moment to
                  adjust to the dark interior. You might let out a small squeal
                  of delight or surprise as your eyes settle on a large
                  perfectly round earthen orb in the middle of the otherwise
                  empty room. (fig. 2) The orb is much larger than the doorway,
                  substantially taller than a person, cracked and slightly
                  desiccated. How did it get here? Why doesn’t it crumble?
                  Further investigation reveals that it’s made of brown clay
                  from the site mixed with horsehair, human hair, and sheep’s
                  wool. People around you take selfies in front of the orb as if
                  they have just emerged from a giant dirt bubble. You smile at
                  each other. The room is called simply <em>Boulder</em>.
                </p>
                <figure class="q-figure q-figure--group">
                  <div class="q-figure--group__row columns"></div>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  “What could possibly be in the next hut,” you wonder. This is
                  the artist’s intention. In his statement for the museum,
                  Goldsworthy wrote, “I don’t want to give anything away.
                  Finding the work inside is part of the sculpture’s nature. If
                  you let it be known they are art, it takes away from the
                  art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  And so you amble over to that entrance. Only a few people are
                  allowed in at one time. You step over the threshold. This room
                  contains no object. Titled <em>Room</em>, it is simply
                  plastered with the earthen material on every wall, ceiling,
                  and floor surface, giving the space an ancient, cave-like
                  quality. (fig. 3) It absorbs sound and light. Is it a house? A
                  mud-covered church? A gremlin’s secret lair? If it rains, will
                  it wash away? A stone exterior, a mud interior. It is unlike
                  anything you have ever seen. You stop to take it in, to
                  consider. In the stopping and sensing, there is a feeling of
                  alertness, and then peace. Time slows down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And finally: the third stone cottage. This one also contains
                  no object, but it holds another surprise. The small room’s
                  back wall recedes in a series of concentric circles that
                  telescope away from the viewer into a false rear wall. (fig.
                  4) The symmetry is perfect, but organic. Circles inside a
                  Euclidean room. The pleasing shapes are universal, mysterious,
                  and safe at the same time. This could be the site of a
                  primeval ritual, harkening back to a womb or a giant owl’s eye
                  or a cosmic wormhole. The room is titled <em>Holes</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You step out into the forest. You feel lighter. Amused.
                  Curious. Tender.
                </p>
                <p>But did you experience awe?</p>
                <p>Let’s break it down.</p>
                <p>
                  Did you experience a sense of surprise and the feeling that
                  this is something out of the ordinary? Decidedly so. What
                  about a sense of mystery? Probably so. Many questions likely
                  arose about both the artistic intention and the technical
                  fabrication. The rooms are made from mud, and yet while much
                  of Goldsworthy’s work is ephemeral, <em>Clay Houses</em> is
                  deceptively sturdy. On a deeper level, you may very well have
                  sensed the mystery behind the human desire to affiliate with
                  biophilic materials and the universal shapes represented. What
                  about vastness? In these rooms, you may have marveled at the
                  time required to hand build the stone structures and the
                  installations within. You may have even subconsciously
                  connected to a deeply evolved sense of human pleasure in these
                  shapes and materials, something that ties you by an invisible
                  thread to your ancient ancestors and to all people. The
                  installation speaks to time, to space, to collective memory.
                  In the presence of this art, perhaps you feel your individual
                  self to be slightly less significant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In case you’re wondering if similar experiences have led you
                  to a classic encounter with awe, researchers from the
                  University of Pennsylvania along with Italian colleagues
                  developed an “Awe Experience Scale” that encompasses six
                  domains.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  In it, viewers rate their responses to such statements as “I
                  noticed time slowing,” “I felt my sense of self was
                  diminished,” “I had the sense of being connected to
                  everything,” “I experienced something greater than myself,” “I
                  had goosebumps, or felt my jaw drop,” and “I felt challenged
                  to mentally process what I was experiencing.” You can add up
                  your scores and see how you fared.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s important to acknowledge, though, that not everyone
                  experiences awe in the same way. As individuals, we have
                  different capacities for awe, just as we have different
                  dispositions to feel optimism or fear.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Some of us are more jaded, less playful, less open to
                  mysteries, and less prone to having goosebumps or a tingly
                  feeling when encountering aesthetic stimuli. According to
                  research in the emerging field of neuroaesthetics, about half
                  of the population generates goosebumps in response to art and
                  poetry (nature, music, and other stimuli aren’t typically
                  measured).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  The personality trait most closely associated with this
                  tendency is openness, characterized by curiosity, exploration,
                  and comfort with novel experiences.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Several years ago, University of Utah psychologist Paula
                  Williams and colleagues made an interesting discovery. They
                  already knew that “aesthetic sensitivity,” i.e., the capacity
                  to be moved by beauty, is associated with prosocial
                  engagement, pro-environmental attitudes, and a sense of
                  connection to the living world. Using brain-imaging data from
                  the Human Connectome Project, Williams’s lab discovered that
                  people who responded positively to the goosebumps question
                  also show greater resting-state connectivity in the white
                  matter in their brains. They show strong neural connections
                  between the sensory-motor parts of their brains and the parts
                  that make up the default mode network, sometimes considered
                  the seat of the self.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  The goosebump people are also the ones who report being the
                  most resilient after stressful life events.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Williams was interested to know why. What was the relationship
                  between being awe prone and being resilient? The brain
                  connectivity itself could be part of the answer. People who
                  are moved by art appear to have an ability to take the sensory
                  stimulation—the chords of a sad song, the vastness of the
                  Milky Way, the pleasure of biophilia—and reflect on their own
                  lives and journeys. When we feel connected to our ancestors or
                  to living plants and animals, we feel less lonely. We gain
                  perspective on our problems. We feel the universality of our
                  plight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Experiencing awe through art amplifies our narrative
                  tendencies, enabling us to connect with the stories being
                  told. We become active participants, cocreating meaning and
                  finding personal resonance. We may find metaphors in the art
                  or build on the artist’s creation to tell ourselves stories
                  about our values, our own growth, or our place in a larger
                  world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The meaning-making theory sounds grand, but Williams has
                  another, more physiologically grounded explanation tied to the
                  slight discomfort we feel when we encounter a novel mystery.
                  The goosebumps themselves—similar to the raised hackles on a
                  dog’s back when facing danger—may be a mini version of a
                  threat response. When we experience something we don’t
                  understand, our nervous system pays close attention. Is this
                  safe? What is happening here? Think of sitting near the horn
                  section during a performance of Beethoven’s Symphony no. 5 in
                  C Minor. The second phrase of the first movement ends with a
                  climactic horn solo in which the sound wave vibrations enter
                  the listener’s body in a dramatic, unfamiliar, even unnerving
                  way. And yet, soon, the listener is wholly caught up in the
                  emotional height of the music followed by the resolution of
                  tension. It’s not an easy or mild experience. As the late
                  neurologist Oliver Sacks put it, “music can pierce the heart
                  directly.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Awe thrives in the face of mystery and the unknown.
                  Experiencing aesthetic awe in this way may be a sort of
                  practice for the stresses of life, argues Williams. “The term
                  I’ve come to use is that it’s a kind of stress inoculation,”
                  she says. “If you do it a lot, then you are always challenging
                  your system a bit and perhaps training yourself to have
                  comfort with novelty and things that are challenging.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>——————</p>
                <p>
                  Of course, not all awe makes us uncomfortable, or at least not
                  for long. Many things that are novel are also highly
                  pleasurable. Accordingly, there are other neurological and
                  endocrinological bases for why we feel good when we encounter
                  awe. One study indicated that while watching videos depicting
                  acts of moral courage, subjects produced more oxytocin, a
                  neurotransmitter linked to emotional bonding, a sense of unity
                  with others, and overall positive well-being.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Encounters with awe may also release dopamine and activate
                  reward networks in the brain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>

                  For a paper published in the journal <em>Emotion</em> in 2015,
                  researchers in Keltner’s lab at UC Berkeley asked one hundred
                  undergraduates to fill out questionnaires assessing their
                  levels of different positive emotions such as amusement,
                  contentment, joy, pride, love, compassion, and awe.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  The subjects also supplied saliva samples to measure an
                  inflammatory cytokine called IL-6. Chronically elevated levels
                  of this molecule are associated with stress as well as
                  numerous illnesses including diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
                  and depression. In the study, those who recently experienced
                  awe had healthier levels of IL-6, and awe was the only
                  positive emotion predicting lower levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Neuroscience studies suggest that awe also quiets down
                  activation in the self-referential default mode network as we
                  either think less about our own dramas in moments of amazement
                  or we connect our problems in a more holistic way to the
                  external stimuli.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Real-world studies in the field confirm awe’s tendency to
                  diminish our egos. In one, researchers asked tourists at both
                  Fisherman’s Wharf (a commercial destination in the city of San
                  Francisco) and a scenic overlook at Yosemite National Park to
                  rate their experiences of awe and draw a picture of themselves
                  on graph paper. The Yosemite tourists experienced far more
                  awe, and they also drew their bodies as 33 percent smaller
                  than the urban tourists. They also wrote their signatures in
                  smaller penmanship.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>

                  After the spectacular solar eclipse in the summer of 2017,
                  psychologists at the University of California, Irvine,
                  analyzed the language of seven million Tweets.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Tweets sent from the cone of totality used significantly more
                  universal words like “we” and fewer individual words like “I.”
                </p>
                <p>Hermann Hesse said it well, if a bit verbosely, in 1926:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [W]henever I experience part of nature, whether with my eyes
                    or another of the five senses, whenever I feel drawn in,
                    enchanted, opening myself momentarily to its existence and
                    epiphanies, that very moment allows me to forget the
                    avaricious, blind world of human need, and rather than
                    thinking of issuing orders, rather than acquiring or
                    exploiting, fighting or organizing, all I do that moment is
                    “wonder,” like Goethe, and not only does this wonderment
                    establish my brotherhood with him, other poets, and sages,
                    it also makes me a brother to those wondrous things I behold
                    and experience as the living world: butterflies and moths,
                    beetles, clouds, rivers and mountains, because while
                    wandering down the path of wonder, I briefly escape the
                    world of separation and enter the world of unity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>

                  Those feelings of noninvolvement, even when brief, are very
                  good for our mental health. In lab experiments that induce
                  awe, volunteers report a reduced awareness of day-to-day
                  stress and feelings of being less hassled. Either because of
                  improved moods or because of something particular to awe
                  itself, volunteers engage in more generous behaviors, for
                  example sharing money earned in computer games or folding more
                  paper cranes for tsunami victims.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Keltner puts it, “Awe is about as good for your mind and
                  body as anything. It reduces inflammation, so it’s good for
                  your immune system. It activates the vagus nerve, which is
                  good for your cardiovascular system. It’s good for your basic
                  digestive processes. And it’s good for your mind. Even ten
                  minutes of awe makes you feel less self-critical, less
                  stressed, less in pain, more creative, and more of just about
                  all the things we care about in the well-being
                  literature.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>——————</p>
                <p>
                  It’s one thing to feel good in the moments during or right
                  after awe. But emerging science also suggests that awe may be
                  the primary mechanism by which people achieve long-term
                  improvements in symptoms of PTSD, in addictive behaviors, and
                  in feelings of fear around terminal illness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Nowhere are these results more apparent than around the
                  therapeutic use of psychedelics. In an extensive series of
                  case-controlled studies at Johns Hopkins Center for
                  Psychedelic &amp; Consciousness Research, where patients are
                  administered psilocybin (a derivative of “magic mushrooms”),
                  more than half of them report cessation of clinical symptoms a
                  year after treatment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  They also report enduring feelings of gratitude, life
                  satisfaction, humility, and well-being. In the high-dose
                  groups, most patients encounter a scientifically assessed
                  “mystical” experience, which is very similar to high scores on
                  the Awe Experience Scale. They see visual patterns, feel that
                  time is suspended, believe they are receiving epiphanic
                  truths, and experience feelings of unity together with a loss
                  of ego. It is, essentially, awe on Miracle-Gro.

                  In a 2018 paper in the
                  <em>International Review of Psychiatry</em>, Professor Peter
                  Hendricks of the University of Alabama speculates that intense
                  or “big” awe is transformative because it breaks down
                  established patterns and narratives of self-concept. What’s
                  left in their place are new valuations of the self and a
                  profound sense of belonging and connection. “For those
                  suffering from depression, end-of-life distress, or other
                  conditions marked by rumination,” writes Hendricks, “attention
                  diverted away from the self and toward the transcendent (e.g.,
                  family, community, the external universe, a belief system) is
                  likely experienced as liberating if not sublime.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Keltner and Haidt put in their 2003 paper, “awe-inducing
                  events may be one of the fastest and most powerful methods of
                  personal change and growth.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Awe researcher Michelle Shiota at Arizona State University
                  agrees, believing that awe opens a rare window of opportunity
                  to change our belief systems about the world and about
                  ourselves. In those moments of amazement, we can reconsider
                  everything we thought we knew. We can form new allegiances and
                  beliefs. But this isn’t always a good thing, she points out.
                  Cult leaders, religious figureheads, celebrities, and
                  politicians utilize the trappings of vastness and physical and
                  moral beauty to gain or indoctrinate new followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Shiota wrote in a 2021 paper, “Awe seems to produce a
                  little earthquake in the mind, a moment of cognitive
                  malleability offering a chance to expand and reconstruct one’s
                  mental model of the world. The model that emerges depends on
                  what happens in the moments during and after encountering the
                  awe stimulus. We still know far too little about that phase of
                  awe.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, she recommends we go out of our way to
                  experience awe, on our terms, often. “Keep your eyes open;
                  notice the unexpected,” she suggests. “Seek out new music,
                  literature, visual art, dance, or drama, and learn to
                  appreciate these art forms more deeply . . . the goal is to
                  deepen your understanding of the art form so that you
                  recognize the revolution, the extraordinary achievement, when
                  you encounter it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  If big awe can be transformative, what about small awe, the
                  kind we are more likely to run into on a regular basis?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many psychologists say yes. While grieving his brother,
                  Keltner sought out narratives of moral beauty, reading
                  biographies of Gandhi. He made an effort to regularly lose
                  himself in music, listening at home and occasionally attending
                  symphonies. Hofstra University PhD student and awe researcher
                  Marianna Graziosi sought relief over the death of a loved one
                  by watching her toddler niece play in the gentle surf of the
                  ocean.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  Michael Amster, a medical doctor and the coauthor of 2023’s
                  <em>The Power of Awe</em>, writes of resolving his depression
                  through finding small moments of natural beauty throughout the
                  day. He calls this practice “micro-dosing awe.” He now
                  prescribes daily awe to his patients suffering from mood
                  disorders and chronic pain**.**<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, says Amster, beauty is all around us. But we need to
                  pay attention and look for it. As Walt Whitman, the patron
                  saint of awe-seekers, wrote, “a leaf of grass is no less than
                  the journey-work of the stars.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we practice tuning into daily moments of beauty, we can
                  learn to get better at cultivating awe. At the same time,
                  we’ll be cultivating a more resilient mindset grounded in
                  curiosity, cognitive flexibility, mindfulness, and creativity,
                  says Utah’s Paula Williams.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once upon a time, it was easy to find awe. Our ancestors
                  looked up at the sky every night. They sat around a fire and
                  told stories of courage. They danced and sang together. They
                  regularly encountered wild animals. They searched for and
                  cherished fresh water and living plants. They worshipped and
                  contemplated cycles of nature. Our capacity to experience awe
                  no doubt helped our species survive, as it allowed individuals
                  to recover from stress. Moreover, it helped bond us to each
                  other to forge the cooperation necessary for our evolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If experiencing the sacred and the awesome are so good for us,
                  and so good for our social fabric, what does it mean that we
                  are living in a manner so disconnected from nature, and
                  increasingly, from face-to-face interactions?
                </p>
                <p>
                  It means this: the burden now falls upon art and culture to
                  help replace the daily awe we used to receive from the natural
                  world and from each other. While the Milky Way is now less
                  accessible, art has in some ways become more accessible than
                  ever before. Online platforms and virtual exhibitions allow
                  individuals from diverse backgrounds to encounter
                  awe-inspiring creations regardless of their geographical
                  location. The intersection of art and science has given rise
                  to awe-inspiring installations that merge aesthetics,
                  technology, and scientific principles. Viewers can experience
                  full-sensory immersive wonders that offer windows into the
                  mysteries of the universe and the complexity of ecological and
                  human systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a society, though, we need to keep improving access to the
                  arts. Opportunities to experience awe should be more equitably
                  distributed across race and class. To be our best human
                  civilization, we should be expanding arts education not
                  shrinking it. We should be teaching children how the natural
                  world works and allowing them to spend more time in outdoor
                  classrooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Encountering awe is central to the emotional and creative core
                  of being human.
