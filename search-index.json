[{"content":"<p>The term “biophilia,” popularized by American biologist and author Edward O. Wilson, describes his theory that humans have evolved as a species deeply intertwined with the intricacies of the natural world. Wilson’s hypothesis invites deep reflection and poses important questions for audiences to consider in our hyper-accelerated digital and urban-centric world. Organized by Darrin Alfred, Curator of Architecture and Design at the Denver Art Museum, <em>Biophilia: Nature Reimagined</em> explores the transformative role that contemporary architects, artists, and designers play in reexamining and reanimating our intrinsic bond with nature.</p>\n<p><em>Biophilia: Nature Reimagined</em> brings together more than eighty imaginative works by more than thirty international participants that collectively highlight the transformative power of nature. Though not substitutes for nature-based experiences, these works invite us to slow down and pay closer attention, prompting a deeper awareness of the natural world and the sense of wonder it evokes.</p>\n<div class=\"dam-logo\">\n <img

in Denver, Colorado, we are fortunate to have so many opportunities to find ourselves in nature: to explore aspen forests, to hike along pristine alpine lakes, and to climb majestic mountains. For centuries, people have been partaking in the health benefits of Colorado’s environment and weather. It has also become clearer, with the ravages and unpredictability of climate change, that these connections to nature can be tenuous and fragile but are more important than ever.</p>\n<p>In our fast-paced and always-connected world, what better place than a museum to slow down and ground ourselves in the present? <a href=\"https://d26jxt5097u8sr.cloudfront.net/file_share/Art%20Museums%20and%20Well-Being.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Many researchers and professionals agree that art and art museums offer beneficial avenues for personal and social well-being</a> through broadening our mindsets, promoting creativity and connection, and allowing us to build our long-term intellectual, social, and psychological resources.</p>\n<p>The exhibition <em>Biophilia: Nature Reimagined</em> presents an alternative way of understanding ourselves and our environment in the face of our growing separation and estrangement from the natural world due to developing technologies and inequalities. It highlights the ways in which a wide range of creatives, including designers, architects, and artists, continue to cultivate our deep psychological, emotional, and spiritual connections with nature. Of course, there are many prongs to these issues, but this exhibition does not focus on the greening of our built environment, sustainability, or combatting climate change. While rooted in science, <em>Biophilia</em> impacts visitors on an emotional level. Many of the works are performative or multisensory, and they all are eclectic and innovative responses to our inherent connection to nature. Further, many of them aim to foster connections between people, creating visually nourishing experiences that prompt positive emotional responses and transform our way of understanding ourselves and our place in the natural world.</p>\n<p>We invite visitors and readers to reflect on their own relationship with nature and how it affects, or can affect, their physical and mental health and their attitudes toward their environments and others. Through the exhibition, we hope many become more conscious about their values and actions and are inspired to take action.</p>\n<p>I’d like to thank Darrin Alfred, Curator of Architecture and Design, for this compelling exhibition, and Kit Bernal, Curatorial Assistant, Architecture and Design, for her research and contributions to the catalog. Many thanks must also be given to all of the lenders as well as the designers and artists who contributed their work and created new pieces for this exhibition.</p>\n<p><em>Biophilia: Nature Reimagined</em> is presented with generous funds from Luncheon by Design and the Adolph Coors Exhibition Endowment Fund, the donors to the Annual Fund Leadership Campaign, and the residents who support the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD).</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"christoph-heinrich"}],"length":439,"subtitle":null,"title":"Director's Foreword","type":"page","url":"http://localhost:8080/foreword/"},{"content":"<p>It is with immense pleasure that I offer my deepest gratitude to the many individuals who contributed to the realization of this project.

The natural environment plays a crucial role in our development, both individual and collective, a link that is as vital today as it ever was. Many religions and Indigenous cultures maintain that humanity is part of nature, that we come from nature, and that the natural world is sacred. Humans have evolved in the company of other life and in a matrix of conditions making this varied existence possible. We continue to rely physically, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually on the quality and richness of our relationships with the natural environment, particularly the flora of our ecosystems.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The eminent American biologist and naturalist Edward O. Wilson coined the term “biophilia” to describe his theory that humans have evolved as beings deeply intertwined with the intricacies of the living world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> In his landmark book <em>Biophilia</em>, Wilson explored how our “innate tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes” could be a biologically based necessity, integral to our development as individuals and as a species.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> This deceivingly romantic and apparently obvious concept conceals complex and universal human needs, and scientific evidence now confirms how the interaction between people and nature is closely linked to our physical, psychological, and cognitive health and well-being.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> In a hyper-accelerated digital and urban-centric world, Wilson’s hypothesis implies serious consequences as billions of people become further estranged from the natural environment.</p>\n<p><em>Biophilia: Nature Reimagined</em> is a testament to this enduring connection and underscores the transformative role played by contemporary designers, artists, and architects in rekindling this bond. As we collectively navigate our rapidly changing world, this digital publication and its accompanying exhibition not only recognize and share a reverence for our need to connect with the rhythms of life but also emphasize the contributions of these creative minds in revitalizing our relationship with the natural world. <em>Biophilia: Nature Reimagined</em> calls upon us to heighten our senses, more closely observe the world around us, and engage in cathartic, quiet moments that allow us to breathe amid the complexities of contemporary life.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, tragic as it is, has highlighted the innate human desire for connection. It has added a greater sense of urgency to the movement to connect children, families, and communities to nature. According to Richard Louv, author of <em>Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder</em>, the pandemic has dramatically increased public awareness of this need.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> Louv, a child advocacy expert, is far from alone in this ever-expanding field of psychological health. Numerous studies have verified the mental and physical benefits of spending time in nature, but for some, it took a pandemic for that need to feel like a necessity. The transformative power of nature continues to be critical in the modern-day human health and well-being literature and practice, and it has been strongly identified as a valid concern by the health sciences.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p><em>Biophilia: Nature Reimagined</em> is divided into three sections, each serving as a reminder that nature’s principles and pleasures can enrich our lives and reconnect us with our natural environment. <a href=\"/natural-analogs/\">“Natural Analogs: Form and Pattern”</a> is a testament to nature’s shapes, structures, and geometries, both living and inanimate. Here, nature’s aesthetic complexities, which conform to simple mathematical laws—the equations that generate patterns, cones and pyramids, spirals and waves, and the topological rules of geometry—find new expressions in a digital age. <a href=\"/natural-systems/\">“Natural Systems: Processes and Phenomena”</a> invites reflection on nature’s dynamic processes and captivating phenomena. These works serve as a bridge between the rhythms of the natural world and the rigidity of the man-made environment, opening our eyes to the intricate beauty and interconnectedness of our planet’s ecosystems. They encourage a sense of wonder and inspire a commitment to preserve and protect our natural world. <a href=\"/topophilia/\">“Topophilia”</a> delves into the spiritual connection between humanity and the physical environment, highlighting the interplay among people, nature, and place. In his book <em>A Reenchanted World</em>, the sociologist James William Gibson says that such connections mostly have been destroyed in modernity but argues that “more and more people are trying to reinvent them.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>This catalog presents supplementary content through the written and spoken word that reflects the subject through various practices. Certified nature and forest therapy guide Kimberly Ruffin leads an audio-guided forest walk, sometimes referred to as forest bathing, or <em>shinrin-yoku</em> in Japan. Described as a “walk of faith,” her guided walk invites listeners to engage their senses and witness the world around them. Author and journalist Florence Williams examines nature’s capacity to generate feelings of awe and reveals how art can offer what we once received from the natural world. Poet Cedar Sigo contributes a new poem inspired by the spiritual and material connections between people and their homeland.</p>\n<p>As you navigate through this publication, keep in mind that our connection with nature is not a luxury but a necessity. <em>Biophilia: Nature Reimagined</em> reminds us that the path to reconnection is ever-present, and artists, designers, and architects can unveil the wisdom and beauty of the natural world. It is a call to action, urging us to embark on a journey of reconnection with nature, not only for ourselves but for future generations. This is no small thing.

The Arts and Crafts movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries emerged as a response to industrialization and urbanization. The movement sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and celebrate the beauty of natural forms. Similarly, the mid-twentieth-century organic design movement was influenced by a desire to create more harmonious relationships between humans and their environment, countering the still lingering negative effects of industrialization.</p>\n<p>The idea that nature can serve as an antidote to technology is a perspective that many people have held over the years. This perspective often arises from concerns about the potential negative effects of technology on various aspects of human life and society. But many designs inspired by nature benefit from the use of technology to replicate or adapt natural forms and structures. These designs often result in highly efficient, structurally logical, and innovative products, systems, or solutions. This concept remains an influential force in shaping contemporary art and design, offering new responses to our relationship with the natural world.</p>\n<p>Natural analogs in architecture, art, and design evoke naturally occurring forms and patterns and aim to establish connections between humans and the natural world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Architects, artists, and designers simulate nature’s boundless shapes, structures, and organizing principles, expressed in a broad spectrum of forms and functions, from appropriating biomorphic forms to mimicking nature’s underlying geometries and growth processes.</p>\n<p>The following works from the fields of architecture, art, and design do not simply imitate nature but use it as a starting point for eclectic and innovative responses to our relationship with our environment. They highlight the uniqueness and dynamism that nature’s forms and patterns have to affect us, tapping into our intimate, emotional, and spiritual connections with the natural world. Natural analogs foster a deeper appreciation for nature’s aesthetics, stimulate feelings of wonder, and promote a sense of responsibility for preserving and coexisting with the natural environment.</p>\n<h3>Form</h3>\n<p>The appropriation of diverse natural forms can lead to the creation of aesthetically pleasing and emotionally satisfying objects. By capturing the beauty of nature in fixed form, artists and designers create captivating environments and imbue spaces with a sense of tranquility and wonder. While our brain knows that these objects are not living things, we describe them as symbolic representations of life.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2023-78-1-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-left\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"exrr-2023-78\" href=\"#exrr-2023-78-1-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Image of Algues installation with many individual, yellow-green colored, seaweed-like components attached together at multiple points.

Achieving a diversity akin to their real-life counterparts, no two works are alike. Paperlike in texture, <em>Coral Flower IV</em> fans outward with organic ripples, its unglazed exterior retaining a finish and texture reminiscent of coral fragments washed onto the shore (cat. 10). Similarly, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec’s <em>Algues</em> (Algae) take cues from the diverse organisms that play crucial roles in our aquatic ecosystems (cat. 5). The interlocking plastic modules can be assembled into endless configurations to form partitions of varying sizes and densities, allowing light to filter through their lacy structure like algae’s captivating translucency.</p>\n<p>David Valner’s <em>Fungus</em> vases and bowls conjure the peculiar forms found in the fascinating world of fungi: from delicate and elongated stalks to intricate and convoluted caps. Valner employs traditional glass making techniques to create these functional objects (cats. 96–107). Their glass surfaces simulate the variable and complex colors observed on fungal bodies found in the damp recesses beneath our feet. Meanwhile, Front’s <em>Curve Lamps</em> appear to grow and adapt to their surroundings. The fixtures reimagine the iconic green-glass banker’s lamps with a contemporary twist (cats. 19–25). Emerging from small yet sturdy bases, the lights stretch and bend upward like a plant or mushroom sprouting from the forest floor, seeking the nourishing rays of the sun.</p>\n<figure id=\"ptl-24650-59-63-64-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"valner-inline\" href=\"#ptl-24650-59-63-64-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Eleven vases and one bowl inspired by the different shapes of mushrooms in different colors, including orange, pink, turquoise, lavender, dark green, and brown.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/PTL-24650-59_PTL-26463-64.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"\" href=\"#ptl-24650-59-63-64-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Cats. 96–107</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">David Valner, <em>Fungus Vases</em> and <em>Polypore Bowl</em>, 2018–23.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Handcrafted glass, various dimensions.

Initially conceived as a digital piece of furniture by Reisinger, the chair was brought to life with Esqué, a textile designer. Upholstered with over 30,000 laser-cut pink polyester petals, the limited-edition chair evokes the feeling of sitting in a blooming flower. Fernando and Humberto Campana’s Bulbo conjures the mysterious tropical flora of the brothers’ native Brazil (cat. 7). The layered petals of the flower-shaped seat gently cradle the sitter to provide a feeling of security and tranquility.</p>\n<p>Crafted by master glassblowers, Andreea Avram Rusu’s <em>Botanica Chandelier</em> resembles the weighty and sculptural blossoms of banana plants in milky pastel hues (cat. 4). The surreal composition—large, pendulous flowers and a series of overlapping leaves suspended from stems wrapped with leather—dynamically responds to the interplay of surrounding light. While Avram Rusu expresses her fascination with plant life in glass form, the lush banana fronds of PELLE’s eye-catching <em>Nana Lure Chandelier</em> are made of cast cotton paper (cat. 81). Illuminated from their undersides, the large, elongated leaves are sculpted and painted by hand. Each leaf is depicted with the accuracy of a botanical illustration, from the prominent vein that runs their length to the gentle wavelike pattern of their weathered edges.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"ptl-24735-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"lamp-inline\" href=\"#ptl-24735-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A chandelier with orange, black, and green tones of blown glass light fixtures hanging from leather stems, inspired by banana flowers and the botanical gardens of Lisbon.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/PTL-24735-essay.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"\" href=\"#ptl-24735-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Cat. 4</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Andreea Avram Rusu, <em>Botanica Chandelier</em>, 2023.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Glass, brass, steel, leather, and LEDs, 135 × 56 × 33 in.

These patterns often emerge as a result of natural processes, physical laws, and interactions among various elements in the environment, but not all are visible to the naked eye. They often require microscopes, mathematical models, and visualizations for us to observe and understand them. Architects and designers often find inspiration in these diverse patterns to create visually captivating and conceptually profound structures.</p>\n<p>In his renowned book from 1979, <em>The Sense of Order</em>, Austrian art historian Ernst Gombrich delves into the psychological aspects of human perception and appreciation of decorative art.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> Gombrich seeks to unravel the underlying reasons behind our fascination with and inclination toward order, symmetry, and geometric patterns in artistic expressions throughout various cultures and historical periods. He argues that the human mind possesses an inherent “sense of order,” which drives our artistic creativity and preferences. This sense of order can be traced back to our evolutionary history, where the ability to identify patterns and regularities in the environment conferred survival advantages. As a result, the human brain developed a natural affinity for finding and creating order in the chaotic world. It is not just a study of art and aesthetics but an exploration of human psychology and cognition. By understanding the psychological foundations of our appreciation for order and symmetry, Gombrich sheds light on the fundamental aspects of human behavior and culture.</p>\n<p>Fractals, in particular, seem to capture the human imagination. Fractals, a term coined in 1975 by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, have effectively quantified the intricate underlying patterns found in many natural objects.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> Fractals are infinitely complex patterns, or mathematical forms, that exhibit self-similarity across different scales. When we look at a fractal, we often see intricate, repetitive patterns that continue to appear at different scales. Mandelbrot argued that fractals and fractal-like patterns that emerge during natural growth processes can be found in various natural phenomena, ranging from the micro- to the macroscale. These include vein patterns in leaves, the branching structure of trees, mountain ranges, river networks, coastlines, waves, and even cloud formations. The examples are nearly limitless. Described as both the “fingerprint of nature”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> and “the new aesthetics,”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> fractal patterns and forms have captured the imaginations of scientists and artists alike.</p>\n<p>Fractals, among other geometrical patterns, have been proven to reduce physiological and emotional stress in humans, playing a significant role in evolutionary aesthetics and environmental psychology.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> Research consistently demonstrates correlations between fractal dimensions in nature and those in architecture, art, and design.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> As humans, we display a consistent aesthetic preference for fractal images, whether or not these images are generated by nature’s processes, mathematical equations, or human creativity.</p>\n<p>Fashion design collective threeASFOUR’s <em>Human Plant</em> collection explores the beauty and complexity of fractal-like structures found within the plant world (cats. 93–95). Employing laser cutting, pleating, and other techniques, the studio creates exquisite plantlike details and textures. Patterns based on the complex network of leaf veins that branch and intersect are printed on skirts, pants, and jackets that wrap the body, such as <em>Autumn Leaf Suit</em>. Cut-out dresses, including <em>Eve Dress</em>, are assembled piece by piece out of components that mimic the intricate network of veins found in some leaves. The parts are laser cut, seemingly leaving behind only the leaves’ structural support. Another ensemble, <em>Lily Dress</em>, captures the aquatic plant’s distinctive circular leaves that rest on the water’s surface. The collection beautifully evokes the harmonious geometries of nature’s abundant foliage. By magnifying these diminutive patterns and distinct structures, threeASFOUR establishes an intimate connection between these geometries and the human body. Ultimately, <em>Human Plant</em> prompts us to look more closely and cherish the mesmerizing details that govern nature’s beauty that often go unnoticed by the human eye.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"ptl-24455-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--3\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"dress-figuregroup\" href=\"#ptl-24455-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Front view of a model walking down the runway wearing a three-piece suit with a light-brown, autumn leaf print.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/PTL-24455_1-3.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"\" href=\"#ptl-24455-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Cat. 93</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">threeASFOUR, <em>Autumn Leaf Suit</em>, <em>Human Plant</em> Collection, Spring/Summer 2020.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Digitally printed cotton voile and broadcloth.

MAYER H. (cat. 37). The structure’s six large timber columns rise from a concrete base to form a dendritic-like canopy that provides shade for the city’s historic Plaza de la Encarnación. The parasols are constructed from an interweaving waffle-like timber lattice that creates continuously shifting shadows throughout the day (cat. 39). The structure creates a distinctive public space that offers shelter and areas to gather and evokes the sense of being under a forest canopy. Its public, open-air spaces feature permeable boundaries and provide spatial freedom reminiscent of nature while fostering a distinct sense of place within the city’s dense historic center. By employing tree, or mushroom, metaphors architecturally, <em>Metropol Parasol</em> achieves a dual purpose: expressing a lamentation for nature’s absence and symbolically inserting its presence.</p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2023-43-1-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"metropol-inline\" href=\"#exrr-2023-43-1-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Aerial color photograph of the Metropol Parasol in Seville, Spain.

Lehanneur and his team employed 3-D special effects software typically used by the film industry to reproduce the complex geometry and movement of water into digital forms. Blocks of marble were then machine cut to replicate the digitally created patterns, before being hand polished to a glossy, liquid-like finish to create a surface that is as reflective as the ocean. <em>Ocean Memories</em> captures a surrealistic vision of an ocean frozen in time, reminding us of the immense power and beauty of nature.</p>\n<figure id=\"ptl-24721-1-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"vanherpen-inline\" href=\"#ptl-24721-1-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Front view of a model wearing a floor-length dress with long sleeves that completely cover their arms.

In the latter part of the twentieth century, the quest to replicate nature’s creative code took an astounding new turn. The simulation of nature’s almost inexpressible patterns became possible through emerging computational technologies, such as generative, parametric, and algorithmic design tools. Geometries that were once extremely challenging or even impossible to fabricate are now realized with advanced computer-assisted production methods known as digital fabrication.</p>\n<figure id=\"ptl-24369-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"lynn-inline\" href=\"#ptl-24369-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A five-piece, silver, botanical-themed flatware set with two types of forks, two types of spoons, and one knife.

Lynn began the process by designing a primitive, yet-to-be-specified, beginning, or “seed,” for the set: a bundle of tines as a handle with webbing, rather than starting with the spoon and altering it to create forks and knives, as Alessi typically does (cat. 67).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup> This initial form served as a kind of DNA code capable of generating an infinite array of utensils. “How do we design a generic starting point which is latent with all of that information that needs to unfold, which lets us make all of the components or all of the elements in the set part of this continuous family?” Lynn wondered.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> To achieve this, Lynn employed animation software, originally developed for the animated film industry, where the primitive form was combined and recombined in numerous ways, facilitating a wide range of configurations and variations for specific functions (cat.68). Each individual utensil was articulated figuratively to reflect its specific function. At once familiar and uniquely strange, the resulting utensils are individually specialized yet collectively related as a family.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"exrr-2022-264-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"lynn-inline\" href=\"#exrr-2022-264-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Black ink sketch of flatware.

These approaches employ input parameters and constraints to advance a design toward a desired outcome, like an evolutionary process. Laarman’s <em>Bone Armchair</em> marked his first foray into using natural science to determine not only the formal appearance of an object but also the underlying structural logic that governs its engineering and construction (fig. 2). Laarman’s <em>Adaptation Chair</em>, from the <em>Microstructures</em> series, draws on the complex patterns of growing branches and roots to adjust its geometry (cat. 41). Laarman engineered the chair starting from the smallest structural and functional unit, or “cell,” imitating nature’s approach of creating the most efficient structures possible. The chair’s legs appear to organically rise from the ground like a tree, redistributing their mass at specific points in response to physical stress. As the legs grow into branches, they fan out into increasingly smaller branches that eventually form and support the seat and back of the chair, akin to how a tree’s branches support its leaf canopy (trees can add material where strength is needed). The final design simulates cellular structures to meet the needs of different areas of the chair. Each component of the chair is essential to the whole.</p>\n<figure id=\"2015-263-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"laarman-inline\" href=\"#2015-263-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A shiny, copper-colored chair with no arms.

Using advanced computer algorithms, the studio generates designs that mimic patterns found in nature. The <em>Floraform Chandelier</em> is an undulating flower-like surface composed of ten branching structures made of 3-D-printed nylon (cat. 80). The structure was grown by two generative algorithms created by Nervous System: Floraform and Hyphae. Floraform explores surface development through differential growth inspired by the biomechanics of growing leaves and blooming flowers. Hyphae is an iterative branching system based on how veins form in leaves. The large, yet airy, suspended light casts a dense forest of shadows, enveloping the viewer in an immersive environment of algorithmically grown plant forms.</p>\n<figure id=\"2022-57-5-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"shapeways-inline\" href=\"#2022-57-5-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A person stands under Floraform Chandelier and holds out an arm, which is cast in shadows from the artwork, as is the wall behind.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/2022_57~5-essay.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"\" href=\"#2022-57-5-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Cat. 80</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Nervous System, <em>Floraform Chandelier</em> (detail), 2017.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">3-D-printed nylon and LED, 43¼ in. dia.

The flora depicted in <em>Wall Flowers: Clover</em> appears to have been extracted from the natural world; however, upon closer inspection, the intricate blooms take on a synthetic appearance, blurring the boundary between the real and the hyperdigital. When visitors engage with the installation, their images are reflected back on a series of mirrored panels. The viewer, then, becomes an integral part of the imaginary landscape. Manferdini’s digital garden immerses the visitor in a sense of natural order taken to an extreme. Her interchange between reality and the digital world raises questions about the fundamental uncertainty of our digital age and its impact upon the human race.</p>\n<p>In their pursuit to replicate natural forms like tropical plants, construct fractal-like structures, or simulate plant growth, architects, artists, and designers harness the power of natural analogs to disrupt our mechanized expectations. They poignantly remind us of the intricate relationships between our industrialized world and the natural environment. Their creative endeavors prompt us to pause, reevaluate, and explore harmonious ways to navigate the realms of human innovation and the enduring beauty of the natural world, urging us toward a more balanced and sustainable coexistence.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Stephen R.

To create their signature shapes, Davolio first throws a simple interior vase or vessel on a wheel, then applies concentric layers of wet porcelain to the outside. Working by hand, she pinches and ruffles the porcelain into thin, almost translucent ridges that bear resemblance to the series’ namesake and inspiration: oceanic coral reefs. <em>Coral Flower IV</em> is made of frit porcelain, an extremely malleable type of porcelain that contains granules of crushed quartz and alkaline glass frit. These inclusions give the vessel a matte texture that appears gritty in some areas, recalling the feeling of shells and coral picked off a sandy beach.</p>\n<p>In addition to the sea, Davolio has also long been inspired by art and objects from ancient Mediterranean cultures, including Greek, Roman, and Etruscan. The pure white porcelain of <em>Coral Flower IV</em> seems to glow from within, evoking the same luminosity as classical marble sculpture. This association is sadly appropriate on another level: although classical sculptures’ pristine whiteness has become synonymous with romantic misconceptions of antiquity, the sculptures were originally brightly painted. Time and environmental factors have degraded the colorful surfaces; in parallel, coral becomes white, or bleached, as a stress response. If the stressful changes in the environment, especially the fluctuating ocean temperatures caused by climate change, continue, bleached coral eventually dies. Between 2014 and 2017, more than 75 percent of the earth’s tropical reefs experienced bleaching.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Davolio’s meticulously crafted vessels, like <em>Coral Flower IV</em>, are a monument to the beauty and fragility of these vital ecosystems.</p>\n<p class=\"is-aligned-right\">Kit Bernal</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Michon Scott and Rebecca Lindsey, “Unprecedented 3 Years of Global Coral Bleaching, 2014–2017,” Climate.gov: Science &amp; Information for a Climate-Smart Nation, August 1, 2018, <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/unprecedented-3-years-global-coral-bleaching-2014%E2%80%932017\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/unprecedented-3-years-global-coral-bleaching-2014–2017</a>. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n","contributor":null,"length":317,"subtitle":null,"title":"Sandra Davolio","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/natural-analogs/object-plates/sandra-davolio/"},{"content":"<p>Looking at the variability and seeming spontaneity of nature, it can be easy to forget that every flower and tree grows in accordance with mathematical and cellular systems.

From a distance, the multimedia installation <em>Wall Flowers: Clover</em> appears to be a lush expanse of floral wallpaper, as our brains fill in the expected pattern. Close looking destabilizes this impression, revealing globular and wildly colored blooms that intersect and intertwine in impossible ways (cat. 73 details). To generate the imagery, Manferdini designed a 3-D-modeled animation of a virtual meadow, swaying gently in a computerized breeze (fig. 1). Stills, each captured at different moments, scales, and densities, are reproduced on the wallpaper and three mirrored panels. The mirrors simultaneously reflect and obscure the viewer as they move through the digital flora. In the subtle variations of time and dimension, the repetitions and cycles of the program become apparent, creating a complex and dense environment that is both appealing and incongruous, wild and synthetic. Viewers are encouraged to photograph their unique encounters with the work, a postcard from an otherworldly landscape.</p>\n<figure id=\"vid-exrr-2023-90\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--vimeo\"> <div class=\"q-figure__media-wrapper q-figure__media-wrapper--manferdini\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <iframe allow=\"fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"q-figure-video-element q-figure-video-element--embed\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/911666911\"></iframe> </div> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"\" href=\"#vid-exrr-2023-90\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Elena Manferdini, <em>Wall Flowers</em>, 2018.

While it’s called a forest walk, it can be done in any outdoor setting, although it should be a site that’s already familiar to you, such as a favorite hiking trail, a city park, or even your own backyard. Set aside about forty-five minutes for this experience, but you can take more time if you’d like. When you are ready, press play and let Ruffin guide you through nature and reflection.</p>\n<section id=\"section-click-to-read-the-transcript\" class=\"accordion-section\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <h5>Click to read the transcript</h5> <div class=\"note\">Note: after “Introduction” the bold title is the name of the invitation; punctuation is reflective of speaking cues</div> <p><strong>Introduction</strong> (3 minutes)<br> Welcome!  My name is Kim, and I’m the Certified Nature and Forest Therapy Guide who’s facilitating this experience. During this “walk of faith,” the working definition of “faith” is a continuous exchange of belonging. The exchange occurs among you, an outdoor place you determine, and the other elements of nature there. In essence, it’s an opportunity to let nature support you and to give a little of yourself in the support of the rest of nature.</p> <p>Here are a few suggestions for getting ready:<br> •\tThe walk will be about forty-five minutes long, including the time when I am speaking and the timed silence included for you to connect with the natural world through your senses.  I’ll let you know good places to pause if you’d like more time.<br> •\tConnection to the ambient noise around you is important.  So, I recommend that you disable notifications on your phone and use the speaker feature on your phone so that my voice can guide you throughout the walk.  Alternatively, you might listen with only one earbud.<br> •\tChoose a site with which you’re already familiar. Forest bathing, as it’s called, can be done in most outdoor settings, even if they are not woodlands.  Consider your backyard or even a city park that’s not too heavily trafficked. This walk is not intended for areas that are new to you.<br> •\tThe walk concludes with an opportunity to sit and reflect using an article of faith, a small, easily carried item that has personal significance.</p> <p>The outdoors can be a place that gives us comfort, speaks to our hearts, puts our minds at ease, and reminds us of all the other beings with which we share this home. We can let nature support us through our senses; all we have to do is drop into the interaction of our bodies with a place.  I’m here to help you ease into this belonging. And to assure you that this will all unfold in the way it was meant to be.  If there was a right way to do this, then you’ve already done it, because your body knows how to be here.  All you need to do is to let it lead.</p> <p>The prompts for you to let your senses lead are called “invitations.” [Chime sound] I’ll be using this sound throughout the walk to mark the end of one invitation and the beginning of another.  So, if you feel like taking more time with an invitation, just press “pause” at the sound of a chime, and when you press “play” again, you’ll be in the right spot to continue.  If you finish before the sound of the chime, just take time to connect with your breath and enjoy being outside.</p> <p>Are you ready?  Even if you’re almost ready, c’mon, let’s get some outside!</p> <p><strong>Pleasures of Presence</strong> (15 minutes)<br> Move to where you want this experience to officially begin.  Have a good spot? (If not, take a pause here and get situated.)  All right, let’s sink in . . .</p> <p>Our first invitation is called Pleasures of Presence.  Notice your breath wherever you feel it most vibrantly . . . your nose, your chest, your belly . . . Take a few more breaths . . . Notice how the air coming from you connects to the air around you . . . As you breathe, plants and animals are also breathing and sharing this air . . . Notice how the atmosphere holds you . . . holds you and the living things in this place where you belong . . . As you breathe fully, be fully present with this place.</p> <p>Begin to shepherd your field of vision closer to you, perhaps to some point on the ground or directly in front of you. We will turn our attention to other senses, but feel free to keep a soft gaze going, or let your eyelids hover gently, or, if you feel comfortable, close your eyes completely.</p> <p>Turn your attention to your sense of touch . . . Our bodies are supported by incredible underground worlds beneath us . . . Notice your body, how it feels to be supported by this place . . . I invite you to rock  back and forth, shift your weight around if you like, until you find a pleasing position . . . Let the earth help you feel centered . . . Let your cares be drawn to the feelings on your skin . . . on your bare skin . . . and sensations where you are clothed . . . What kinds of qualities are in this experience of touch? . . . Notice what touch sensations are giving you pleasure . . . Invite that pleasure in . . .</p> <p>Now I invite you to make a shift to your hearing . . . What sounds are around you? . . . Notice the variety of sounds . . . Notice any interaction of the sounds with each other . . . Is there a rhythm to the sounds? . . . Take a moment to connect with the furthest sound you can hear . . . Now bring your attention to the closest sound you can hear . . . Take a moment to tune into the sound of your own breathing . . . Let it blend in with the sounds around you . . . What is it like to be a part of the music of this place? . . . What within the experience of sound is giving you pleasure? . . . Invite that pleasure in . . .</p> <p>You’ll now turn your attention to the two closely related senses of taste and smell . . . Open your mouth and breathe through your mouth and nose together . . . Just notice the textures of the air . . . Taste receptors are all over the tongue, so you may even want to stick your tongue out to better taste the biotic conversation going on around you. Don’t worry, the earth’s not going to take offense . . . Are there new scents that weren’t apparent at first? . . . Raise your head and smell the air . . . Does scent seem different here? . . . Lower your head . . . Again, how does scent seem here? . . . Raise your head back to center and experience any other qualities the air has . . . Where in this experience of taste and smell does pleasure appear? . . . Invite that pleasure in also . . .</p> <p>If you haven’t done so already, if it feels right, you can have your eyes closed for the last part of this invitation. Imagine you’re in the middle of a circle that has four directions marked . . . To begin, turn a quarter of this circle to the right to the first direction, don’t worry about how accurate you are, just take this opportunity to feel . . . With your hands out and your entire body sensing as one knowing organ . . . just feel the presence of this direction and notice what it is like . . .</p> <p>And turning another quarter circle to your right, eyes closed or in a soft gaze, take in the presence of this direction and just notice what it’s like, its way of being present . . . How does it feel . . . sound . . . smell . . . ?</p> <p>And once again, turn a quarter circle to your right. Do you feel qualities of this direction that are different than the qualities of the other directions? What are these qualities, and how are your senses letting you experience them? . . .</p> <p>And turning a quarter circle to the right, give yourself the opportunity to feel this fourth direction . . . its presence . . . and how it touches into you . . . What is revealed by being present in this direction? . . .</p> <p>Holding your hands slightly out and put your palms forward, I invite you to get a second helping of one of these directions. Just slowly rotate your body in a circle until it arrives at a knowing of what direction it wants to face . . . Just find that place, where your body is saying “Yes” and still with your eyes closed, breathe in this direction with your heart . . . In a moment, but not until I say so . . . you will open your eyes or focus your gaze . . . and when you do, I invite you to see what appears using your heart sense, like you were seeing it for the first time . . . and now . . . open or focus your eyes . . .</p> <p>Is there a gesture you want to make toward that which you are seeing? . . .  What are you noticing? . . . Take a moment to honor your sensations at this moment . . . [Chime sound]</p> <p><strong>What’s in Motion?</strong> (7 minutes)<br> Our bodies move in so many ways . . . run, jog, dance, walk . . . and . . . we . . . can . . . move . . . like . . . sloths . . . carefully . . . moseying up a tree . . . The next invitation is called “What’s in Motion?” and this is an opportunity to explore an unhurried pace of movement that will let you sense what’s in motion, on the inside and the outside. Now your mind is one part of who you are that might want to go faster and race around to this, that, and the other thing while you’re walking leisurely. If that’s going on, all you have to do is usher your body back to the question “what’s in motion?”  So, maybe go a little slower than you usually do and give this place that you’ve chosen a stroll or a saunter and take the question “what’s in motion?” with you . . . You’ll hear the chime when it’s time to continue.</p> <p>[Timed silence then chime sound]</p> <p><strong>(Fill in the Blank) as My Witness</strong> (6 minutes)<br> Witnesses are a part of Forest Therapy . . . They are nonjudgmental observers that summon relationship. There are a host of ways that more-than-human nature is acutely aware of what’s going on around it. This place knows you’re here and is witnessing you right now. Some parts of nature see without eyes, smell without noses, and feel without hands. Some researchers have concluded that plants even remember. Through these sensations of nature, other living things serve as a witness to your presence in this place.  So, the name of this invitation starts with a blank that you’ll fill in. It’s called “(Fill in the Blank) as My Witness.” Take a wander and use sight, sound, and touch, to notice all of the natural witnesses around you. For instance, you might look at the ground and say “Soil as my witness” or let yourself be drawn to a tree, touch it and utter in your mind “Tree as my witness.” Feel free to linger with any of these witnesses and yield your attention to their senses and yours.  You’ll hear the chime when it’s time to continue.</p> <p>[Timed silence then chime sound]</p> <p><strong>Where’s Water?</strong>  (6 minutes)<br> How are you feeling? Ready? If not, take a pause here before we continue.</p> <p>For this next invitation, I ask that you let your body lead you to something very old: WATER. So this invitation is called “Where’s Water?” Of course, there is no new water, so the raindrop that dripped down a dinosaur’s forehead is still on Earth somewhere. Even if you’re not near a pond or a puddle, water is where you are. And, you have more than your vision to help you find it. Let the water in you be drawn to the water outside.  In whatever form you find it, take a moment to sense where this water has been, any of its past places. You might even want to name these places out loud and use sound to connect you with the water of this place. “A frog-filled pond, Cleopatra’s cup, deep inside a tree . . .” Take some time now to sense “Where’s water?” You’ll hear my chime again, when it’s time to move on.</p> <p>[Timed silence then chime sound]</p> <p><strong>Skywalker</strong> (8 minutes)<br> The sky reaches all the way to the ground, and at this very moment, it is hovering over what connects you to the earth. With this invitation called “Skywalker,” take some time to skywalk and sense how it feels to be where the sky and earth meet. This is our next-to-last invitation, so you can use this opportunity to make your way to where you’d like to sit and end the walk. As you’re skywalking there, let your body’s attention float to what you feel as you move within the lowest layer of sky.</p> <p>[Timed silence then chime sound]</p> <p><strong>Closing Ceremony—An Article of Faith</strong> (5 minutes total)<br> You’ve come this far by faith: the continuous exchange among you, the place you’re in, and all the nature there. This last invitation is called “An Article of Faith,” and it’s an opportunity to deepen your memories of this experience as you begin to move back into your regular activities with the walk coursing through your body.</p> <p>If you wish to sit, please do so now. Here’s a little time to get situated. You’ll hear my voice again for the close.</p> <p>[Chime sound then timed silence here: 3 minutes]</p> <p>Remember that object I asked you to bring? Now it’s time to take out your article of faith and hold it . . . As you hold it, take some time to let the memories you want to keep of your walk surface . . . Imbue your memories on this special item as you hold this article of faith or simply put your memories in the pockets of your mind. To help this along, I’m going to recount slowly the names of the invitations used in this walk: Pleasures of Presence . . . As My Witness . . . Where’s Water . . . Skywalker . . . An Article of Faith.</p> <p>Now, as you take some final moments to reflect, feel free to write, draw, or imprint with any materials you brought. Relax and refresh with water and a snack, as you like. To close, I’d like to thank the place you chose to do this walk, and you for taking this walk of faith. And to end this experience, with three notes of this chime, we will close our time.</p> <p>[Concluding, three-note chime sound]</p> <p>[End of transcript]</p> </section> <details class=\"accordion-section\" id=\"section-click-to-read-the-transcript\"  data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <summary class=\"accordion-section__heading accordion-section__heading-level-5 accordion-section__controls accordion-section__controls--arrow\" tabindex=\"1\"> <button aria-label=\"Copy page section link to clipboard\" class=\"accordion-section__copy-link-button\" data-outputs-exclude=\"pdf,epub\" value=\"#section-click-to-read-the-transcript\" tabindex=\"2\" > § </button> <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"accordion-tooltip\" data-outputs-exclude=\"pdf,epub\" > Copied page section link to clipboard </span> <h5>Click to read the transcript</h5> </summary> <section class=\"accordion-section__body\"><div class=\"note\">Note: after “Introduction” the bold title is the name of the invitation; punctuation is reflective of speaking cues</div> <p><strong>Introduction</strong> (3 minutes)<br> Welcome!

Notice what touch sensations are giving you pleasure . . . Invite that pleasure in . . .</p> <p>Now I invite you to make a shift to your hearing . . . What sounds are around you? . . . Notice the variety of sounds . . . Notice any interaction of the sounds with each other . . . Is there a rhythm to the sounds? . . . Take a moment to connect with the furthest sound you can hear . . . Now bring your attention to the closest sound you can hear . . . Take a moment to tune into the sound of your own breathing . . . Let it blend in with the sounds around you . . . What is it like to be a part of the music of this place? . . . What within the experience of sound is giving you pleasure? . . . Invite that pleasure in . . .</p> <p>You’ll now turn your attention to the two closely related senses of taste and smell . . . Open your mouth and breathe through your mouth and nose together . . . Just notice the textures of the air . . . Taste receptors are all over the tongue, so you may even want to stick your tongue out to better taste the biotic conversation going on around you. Don’t worry, the earth’s not going to take offense . . . Are there new scents that weren’t apparent at first? . . . Raise your head and smell the air . . . Does scent seem different here? . . . Lower your head . . . Again, how does scent seem here? . . . Raise your head back to center and experience any other qualities the air has . . . Where in this experience of taste and smell does pleasure appear? . . . Invite that pleasure in also . . .</p> <p>If you haven’t done so already, if it feels right, you can have your eyes closed for the last part of this invitation. Imagine you’re in the middle of a circle that has four directions marked . . . To begin, turn a quarter of this circle to the right to the first direction, don’t worry about how accurate you are, just take this opportunity to feel . . . With your hands out and your entire body sensing as one knowing organ . . . just feel the presence of this direction and notice what it is like . . .</p> <p>And turning another quarter circle to your right, eyes closed or in a soft gaze, take in the presence of this direction and just notice what it’s like, its way of being present . . . How does it feel . . . sound . . . smell . . . ?</p> <p>And once again, turn a quarter circle to your right. Do you feel qualities of this direction that are different than the qualities of the other directions? What are these qualities, and how are your senses letting you experience them? . . .</p> <p>And turning a quarter circle to the right, give yourself the opportunity to feel this fourth direction . . . its presence . . . and how it touches into you . . . What is revealed by being present in this direction? . . .</p> <p>Holding your hands slightly out and put your palms forward, I invite you to get a second helping of one of these directions. Just slowly rotate your body in a circle until it arrives at a knowing of what direction it wants to face . . . Just find that place, where your body is saying “Yes” and still with your eyes closed, breathe in this direction with your heart . . . In a moment, but not until I say so . . . you will open your eyes or focus your gaze . . . and when you do, I invite you to see what appears using your heart sense, like you were seeing it for the first time . . . and now . . . open or focus your eyes . . .</p> <p>Is there a gesture you want to make toward that which you are seeing? . . .  What are you noticing? . . . Take a moment to honor your sensations at this moment . . . [Chime sound]</p> <p><strong>What’s in Motion?</strong> (7 minutes)<br> Our bodies move in so many ways . . . run, jog, dance, walk . . . and . . . we . . . can . . . move . . . like . . . sloths . . . carefully . . . moseying up a tree . . . The next invitation is called “What’s in Motion?” and this is an opportunity to explore an unhurried pace of movement that will let you sense what’s in motion, on the inside and the outside. Now your mind is one part of who you are that might want to go faster and race around to this, that, and the other thing while you’re walking leisurely. If that’s going on, all you have to do is usher your body back to the question “what’s in motion?”  So, maybe go a little slower than you usually do and give this place that you’ve chosen a stroll or a saunter and take the question “what’s in motion?” with you . . . You’ll hear the chime when it’s time to continue.</p> <p>[Timed silence then chime sound]</p> <p><strong>(Fill in the Blank) as My Witness</strong> (6 minutes)<br> Witnesses are a part of Forest Therapy . . . They are nonjudgmental observers that summon relationship. There are a host of ways that more-than-human nature is acutely aware of what’s going on around it. This place knows you’re here and is witnessing you right now. Some parts of nature see without eyes, smell without noses, and feel without hands. Some researchers have concluded that plants even remember. Through these sensations of nature, other living things serve as a witness to your presence in this place.  So, the name of this invitation starts with a blank that you’ll fill in. It’s called “(Fill in the Blank) as My Witness.” Take a wander and use sight, sound, and touch, to notice all of the natural witnesses around you. For instance, you might look at the ground and say “Soil as my witness” or let yourself be drawn to a tree, touch it and utter in your mind “Tree as my witness.” Feel free to linger with any of these witnesses and yield your attention to their senses and yours.  You’ll hear the chime when it’s time to continue.</p> <p>[Timed silence then chime sound]</p> <p><strong>Where’s Water?</strong>  (6 minutes)<br> How are you feeling? Ready? If not, take a pause here before we continue.</p> <p>For this next invitation, I ask that you let your body lead you to something very old: WATER. So this invitation is called “Where’s Water?” Of course, there is no new water, so the raindrop that dripped down a dinosaur’s forehead is still on Earth somewhere. Even if you’re not near a pond or a puddle, water is where you are. And, you have more than your vision to help you find it. Let the water in you be drawn to the water outside.  In whatever form you find it, take a moment to sense where this water has been, any of its past places. You might even want to name these places out loud and use sound to connect you with the water of this place. “A frog-filled pond, Cleopatra’s cup, deep inside a tree . . .” Take some time now to sense “Where’s water?” You’ll hear my chime again, when it’s time to move on.</p> <p>[Timed silence then chime sound]</p> <p><strong>Skywalker</strong> (8 minutes)<br> The sky reaches all the way to the ground, and at this very moment, it is hovering over what connects you to the earth. With this invitation called “Skywalker,” take some time to skywalk and sense how it feels to be where the sky and earth meet. This is our next-to-last invitation, so you can use this opportunity to make your way to where you’d like to sit and end the walk. As you’re skywalking there, let your body’s attention float to what you feel as you move within the lowest layer of sky.</p> <p>[Timed silence then chime sound]</p> <p><strong>Closing Ceremony—An Article of Faith</strong> (5 minutes total)<br> You’ve come this far by faith: the continuous exchange among you, the place you’re in, and all the nature there. This last invitation is called “An Article of Faith,” and it’s an opportunity to deepen your memories of this experience as you begin to move back into your regular activities with the walk coursing through your body.</p> <p>If you wish to sit, please do so now. Here’s a little time to get situated. You’ll hear my voice again for the close.</p> <p>[Chime sound then timed silence here: 3 minutes]</p> <p>Remember that object I asked you to bring? Now it’s time to take out your article of faith and hold it . . . As you hold it, take some time to let the memories you want to keep of your walk surface . . . Imbue your memories on this special item as you hold this article of faith or simply put your memories in the pockets of your mind. To help this along, I’m going to recount slowly the names of the invitations used in this walk: Pleasures of Presence . . . As My Witness . . . Where’s Water . . . Skywalker . . . An Article of Faith.</p> <p>Now, as you take some final moments to reflect, feel free to write, draw, or imprint with any materials you brought. Relax and refresh with water and a snack, as you like. To close, I’d like to thank the place you chose to do this walk, and you for taking this walk of faith. And to end this experience, with three notes of this chime, we will close our time.</p> <p>[Concluding, three-note chime sound]</p> <p>[End of transcript]</p> </section> </details><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Bum-Jin PARK et al., “Physiological and Psychological Effects of Walking in Stay-in Forest Therapy [in Japanese],” 日衛誌 (Jpn.

Social ecologist Stephen Kellert, whose research and writing advanced the understanding of the connection between humans and the natural world, pointed to biophilia as “the inherent human inclination to affiliate with natural systems and processes, most particularly life and life-like (e.g., ecosystems) features of the nonhuman environment.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> There is limited, but growing, scientific documentation of the health impacts associated with access to natural systems. These systems, or at least their observable characteristics, are believed to enhance positive health responses. Kellert acknowledged that seeing and understanding the processes of nature can create a perceptual shift in what’s being seen and experienced.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> This relationship has a strong temporal element, as seen in Japanese culture’s celebration of the ephemerality of cherry blossoms and some Indigenous cultures’ view of auroras as the spirits of ancestors or celestial dancers.</p>\n<p>Over the past twenty years, technology has greatly reshaped our world and our relationship to it. The proliferation of technological achievements, like the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, continues, distracting us from other relationships, including our connection with natural systems. But what if it could reconnect us instead? It is perhaps no surprise that the use of cutting-edge technologies to manifest the wonders of nature is burgeoning among contemporary artists and designers who meditate on how humans and the natural world are intricately intertwined and interdependent.</p>\n<p>The following artworks go beyond making use of nature’s forms or patterns to evoke the natural rhythms of life—the fundamental exchange of energy between organisms and their environments. These experiences create meaningful, direct connections with natural processes and phenomena, particularly through movement and other multisensory interactions. They invite us to slow down, pay attention, and trust what our bodies already understand. In doing so, they foster a relationship with a greater whole, triggering a deeper awareness of the nature of life and the sense of awe and wonder we can experience when immersed in it. While they are not a replacement for the real thing, these encounters can cultivate surprise, delight, and even empathy. They may even inspire stewardship of the ecosystems within which we all exist.</p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2023-92-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-left\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"shylight-inline\" href=\"#exrr-2023-92-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Color photograph of Shylight displayed in the New York City Ballet Theater.

DRIFT manifests the phenomena and hidden properties of nature with the use of technology to reestablish our connection to it. “DRIFT reconnects people with nature through art,” according to Nauta. “We create spaces where the viewer is tuned into rhythms resembling natural movements such as the blossoming of flowers, flocks of flying birds, and sea waves.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>DRIFT’s <em>Shylight</em> and <em>Meadow</em> examine how a man-made object can mirror and amplify nature’s subtle wonders (fig. 1 and cat. 14). The kinetic installations feature mechanical flowers made from layers of diaphanous silk, and integrated LED lights illuminate them from within. Suspended from above, each fixture is programmed to mimic the nastic movement of blossoms that open and close in reaction to changing light. <em>Shylight</em> and <em>Meadow</em> emulate the biological behavior of nyctinasty but do not strictly copy it. Going beyond mere imitation, DRIFT’s flowers are oversized, and the speed of their movement is accelerated. The results give the impression of experiencing the phenomena under a magnifying glass and at a quickened pace.</p>\n<figure id=\"ptl-24706-2-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"meadow-inline\" href=\"#ptl-24706-2-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Photograph of Meadow installed in a gallery.

The installation’s ethereal appearance contradicts the complex technical components and custom software that took DRIFT years to develop. <em>Shylight</em> feels alive due to its carefully choregraphed movements that are based on natural human rhythms, such as heartbeats and breathing. While the blossoms in <em>Shylight</em> appear to move individually and independently from one another, <em>Meadow</em> could be understood as a single organism—an interconnected field of colorful flowers that perpetually open and close in sequence. <em>Meadow</em>’s rhythmic and persistent change awakens not only the senses but also the imagination, as it delves into the uncanny nature of a sentient environment. We experience <em>Meadow</em> more like we see ourselves: with character, body language, and a collective story.</p>\n<figure id=\"vid-exrr-2023-93\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--vimeo\"> <div class=\"q-figure__media-wrapper q-figure__media-wrapper--widescreen\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <iframe allow=\"fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"q-figure-video-element q-figure-video-element--embed\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/911666928\"></iframe> </div> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"\" href=\"#vid-exrr-2023-93\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 2</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">DRIFT, <em>Shylight</em>, 2006. © 2024 DRIFT.

Originally conceived for the palliative care unit at the Diaconesses Croix Saint-Simon Hospital Group in Paris, Lehanneur’s <em>Tomorrow Is Another Day</em> (<em>Demain est un autre jour</em>) generates a digital animation of tomorrow’s sky (cat. 61). Installed on the wall of a patient’s room, <em>Tomorrow Is Another Day</em> broadcasts a slowly and continuously moving image of the atmosphere through its circular screen. “It’s not a video that plays the same images of the same sky over and over again,” Lehanneur explains.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> The designer worked with a computer programmer to create custom software that aggregates meteorological and atmospheric data, such as the time of day, color of the sky, speed and transparency of clouds, and humidity, from the internet in real time to create an animation of tomorrow’s sky. The aperture can be customized to reflect specific locations, providing a sense of familiarity and personalization.</p>\n<p>Lehanneur’s concept purposely fosters a profound therapeutic and poetic experience for the patients who observe it, aiming to reestablish their connection with the ever-changing weather patterns of the natural world. According to Lehanneur, “There were infinite variations of grays, cloudy silhouettes, and light intensity that had to be reproduced. Paradoxically, it was necessary to reach this level of sophistication so that the patient could let their mind go, as if lying in a field, eyes turned to the sky.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> It’s a reminder that no two clouds or skies are ever the same.</p>\n<p>These vital aspects of nature often remain concealed from patients and other individuals in healthcare facilities, yet passive visual experiences hold the potential to offer profound benefits through diverse encounters with nature. Stress recovery theory (SRT) proposes that contact with natural environments reduces the psychophysiological stress level of individuals, while attention restoration theory (ART) suggests that mental fatigue and concentration can be improved by time spent in, or looking at, nature.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> <em>Tomorrow Is Another Day</em> not only captures these elusive natural phenomena but also transforms them into spiritual experiences for patients and their families. It prompts contemplation on the concepts of permanence and impermanence, the fundamental principles of uncertainty, and spirituality. Ultimately, the artwork offers a unique opportunity to transcend the confines of time itself.</p>\n<p>Works like Lehanneur’s <em>Tomorrow Is Another Day</em>, DRIFT’s <em>Meadow</em>, or J. MAYER H.’s <em>Metropol Parasol</em> (see <a href=\"/natural-analogs/\">“Natural Analogs”</a>) conjure dynamic and diffuse natural light conditions that change from moment to moment because of varying atmospheric conditions or the fluttering of leaves in a canopy of a stand of aspen trees.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> The fractal patterns of light and shadow on a surface are an expression of time and motion that can attract our attention, evoke a sense of calm, and help connect us with the rhythms of life.</p>\n<p>London-based Dutch artist Simon Heijdens reinterprets natural processes with unique technologies, embedding them in man-made surroundings to uncover the hidden essence of a place. Meteorological conditions, including sunlight and wind, along with custom algorithms and human interactions, dynamically transform the artist’s responsive artworks in real time, giving rise to ever-changing forms. Despite their technical complexity, Heijdens’s installations possess a restrained and poetic appearance, seamlessly integrated into their respective settings. They provoke contemplation on the significance of nature and coincidence in an increasingly developed world while offering moments of exploration, wonder, and introspection.</p>\n<figure id=\"ptl-26101-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-left\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"heijdens-inline\" href=\"#ptl-26101-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Image of digital light projection on the wall of plant life that reacts to visitors as they pass by.

These virtual plants grow indoors but depend closely on actual rain and sunlight, swaying with the wind. <em>Lightweeds</em> responds in real time to the ever-changing weather conditions of the outside world, as measured through sensors placed on the exterior of the building or obtained through live online weather data. As people pass by, the willowy weeds shudder and sway, eventually pollinating. Their seeds trail passers-by before dispersing throughout the space. With their continuous cycle of growth and decay, the plants’ location and density reveal insights into the way the building is utilized.</p>\n<p><em>Lightweeds</em> not only chronicles the passage of time but also captures the evolution of the natural surroundings. Generated from a specific locality and in a state of constant flux, the digital projection introduces an element of chance and time into the built environment. By doing so, it unveils the natural processes and phenomena that are gradually disappearing from our increasingly conditioned, static, and climate-controlled urban lives. <em>Lightweeds</em> serves as a visual reminder to reengage with the inherent beauty and vitality of the natural world that surrounds us.</p>\n<p><em>Flowers and People – A Whole Year per Hour</em> addresses the fleeting nature of the seasons and the interactional relationship between humans and the natural world (cat. 92). The interactive digital artwork vividly depicts a year’s worth of seasonal flowers that continuously change. The flowers gradually and repeatedly sprout, grow, bud, and blossom until their petals eventually scatter and fade across the artwork’s multiple screens. The cycles of growth and efflorescence advance through spring, summer, fall, and winter at an accelerated pace. As the title suggests, one year passes in the span of an hour.</p>\n<figure id=\"ptl-25755-2-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"teamlab-inline\" href=\"#ptl-25755-2-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Interactive digital installation made up of large vertical, adjacent screens.

People lived more closely aligned to the rules of nature that created a comfortable natural environment . . . . We hope to explore a form of human intervention based on the premise that nature cannot be controlled.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> <em>Flowers and People</em> heightens the participants’ awareness of the world they inhabit and can inspire a reconsideration of their own impact upon shared ecosystems. In an increasingly divisive world in which feelings of alienation and isolation are replacing those of relationship and community, such experiences are fundamental to our well-being.</p>\n<p>In an era dominated by technology and a growing disconnection from nature, it is crucial to find ways to reconnect with the natural world. The use of cutting-edge technologies in art and design offers a unique opportunity to bridge this gap and evoke a sense of wonder and awe through engaging experiences. Artists and designers utilize technology to manifest the beauty and intricacies of natural systems, reminding us of our inherent connection to the environment. These artworks invite us to slow down, pay attention, and engage with the rhythms of life. By experiencing these digital interpretations of nature’s systems and processes, we can cultivate a deeper appreciation and understanding of the ecosystems that surround us, fostering a sense of stewardship and inspiring positive change. Through art, technology, and our own active participation, we have the power to rekindle our relationship with the natural world and forge a harmonious future.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Stephen R.

In 1984, psychologist and architect Roger Ulrich published a study that found gallbladder-surgery patients who could see trees through their windows were recorded as requesting less pain medication and described by hospital staff as having better attitudes than patients in rooms without green views.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> In an important distinction, however, <em>Tomorrow Is Another Day</em> was designed for a palliative care unit, where patients face complex illnesses, frequently with unfavorable prognoses. The average duration of a stay is only twelve days.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> Employees of the hospital noticed that patients and their families often struggled for conversation, which Lehanneur believed to be due to the uncertainty of terminal illness. In seeing the next day’s weather patterns, which can be programmed to any location in the world, patients and their loved ones are reconnected to an idea of the future and can visualize themselves in it. <em>Tomorrow Is Another Day</em> reaffirms the importance of nature and its processes in the lives of people, especially in difficult periods, through something as mundane as experiencing—and talking about—the weather.</p>\n<p class=\"is-aligned-right\">Kit Bernal</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Florence Williams, <em>The Nature Fix: Why Nature Makes Us Happier, Healthier, and More Creative</em> (New York: W.

In form, it incorporates elements of fine art, technology, immersive spectacle, and natural imagery. More importantly to the collective, however, it aims to explore the relationship between the self and the world as well as new forms of perception. In <em>Flowers and People - A Whole Year per Hour</em>, vibrant blossoms erupt and scatter across multiple screens. Resembling illuminated paper cutouts, the flowers grow and dissolve according to programming that continuously renders the imagery in response to real-time actions of visitors. As people stand still by the work, flowers bloom abundantly in front of them; when they move away, the petals scatter and disappear. <em>Flowers and People</em> transforms through visitor presence, speaking to the fundamental effects of human action on nature. In this case, humans are the catalyst for beauty and growth, and their absence creates a void, aligning with teamLab’s goal to “create an experience where the relationship between the world and oneself is borderless and continuous.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The movement of <em>Flowers and People</em> become more dramatic as more people interact with it, encouraging affiliation with the actions of other viewers.

In his mid-50s, Rolf Keltner was losing his battle with cancer. The older brother rested his hand on Rolf’s shoulder. He sensed a light radiating from his brother, a force around his body, pulling him away. He felt immense sorrow but also the enormity of the mysteries of life and death. In the presence of his brother and these immemorial forces of time, he briefly lost his sense of being an embodied individual.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Keltner, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, later understood exactly what he’d experienced in that moment: awe. Keltner had been studying this emotion for years, usually in his lab, elicited in volunteers watching videos of things like the Earth from space. But occasionally Keltner and his colleagues would take subjects out into the real world to stand under giant trees or raft in the wilderness or look at dinosaur skeletons in a museum while filling out questionnaires or offering up saliva to test hormones.</p>\n<p>A child of a painter and a poet growing up in the ’60s, Keltner was in some ways primed to study this emotion.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> Natural beauty was all around: Men were landing on the moon. His neighbors in Topanga Canyon included some of the decade’s most enduring musicians. Until Keltner was out of graduate school, the emotion of awe had hardly been studied by academics, even those who specialize in emotions. And yet, argued Keltner, it lay at the very heart of what it means to be human.</p>\n<p>Closely linked to mysticism and other transcendental feelings, awe has been shown to foster cooperation, humility, reverence, caretaking, emotional well-being, and physical health.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>It may be the defining emotion of our species.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it’s no coincidence that as so much in our world seems to be teetering on the edge of instability—environmental change, social fragmentation, technological distrust, postpandemic malaise, anxiety, and disease—awe is enjoying something of a moment. As scientific studies elevate the status of this emotion, as more clinicians recommend it to patients, as more people on their own seem to be craving analog experiences and connections to each other, to art, and to the natural world, awe is now, in some circles, touted as a plausible and necessary corrective to despair.</p>\n<p>But what exactly is awe? And why does it sometimes precipitate dramatic mental and physical effects?</p>\n<p>In attempting to define this somewhat ineffable emotion, Keltner and fellow psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote a groundbreaking paper on the topic in 2003. Titled “Approaching Awe, a Moral, Spiritual, and Aesthetic Emotion,” it surveys the writings of mystics, poets, and philosophers, including Edmund Burke, who in 1757 described the sublime, in Keltner and Haidt’s words, “as the feeling of expanded thought and greatness of mind that is produced by literature, poetry, painting, and viewing landscapes.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>The paper goes on to explain that people often feel awe in the presence of vast natural features such as sweeping views, mountains, storms, and oceans. But the authors noted that “vastness” can refer to conceptual vastness as well, such as quantum physics or evolution or any idea that blows your mind. People can also feel awe in response to objects with infinite, or just alluring, repetition, such as fractal patterns found in forests, along coastlines, and in cloud formations. Fractal patterns, according to mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, are patterns that repeat at different scales and express some principles of unity, symmetry, and self-similarity.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> It’s no wonder that nature facilitates states of awe.</p>\n<p>But vastness is not the only ingredient. Awe requires something of a double take. While encountering awe, we are jolted—even momentarily—out of the ordinary. We may be a little surprised, a little confused, certainly fully absorbed. Keltner and Haidt conclude that a classic awe experience must encompass two main components: a sense of vastness and a little bit of mystery to the point that we seek to adjust our mental maps.</p>\n<p>In his 2023 book, <em>Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Life</em>, Keltner expands on this earlier definition to include a third component: a feeling that we are part of systems larger than the self. This is ultimately what makes awe a transcendent—and healing—emotion.</p>\n<p>To figure out how often people experience awe and under what conditions, Keltner and colleagues gathered thousands of narratives from twenty-six countries. They broke the results into eight major categories of awe, or as Keltner puts it, “wonders of life”:</p>\n<h4>Moral Beauty</h4>\n<p>People around the world are most moved to awe by witnessing other people in acts of courage, love, strength, kindness, and overcoming.</p>\n<h4>Collective Effervescence</h4>\n<p>A phrase coined by French sociologist Émile Durkheim, it refers to shared experiences leading to an electric and powerful sense of “we,” including weddings, funerals, political rallies, dancing, singing, or marching together, watching an eclipse in a group, and so on.</p>\n<h4>Nature</h4>\n<p>Nature-elicited awe, such as from viewing impressive features or encountering wildlife, accounts for about a quarter of contemporary awe experiences.</p>\n<h4>Music</h4>\n<p>Hearing music, playing music, chanting, and singing can transport us, fill us with vibrations, and make us feel connected to something beyond ourselves through symbols and physical sensation.</p>\n<h4>Visual Design</h4>\n<p>From patterns to colors to hallucinations to architectural grandeur, visual design can open, in Aldous Huxley’s famous phrase, the “doors of perception.”</p>\n<h4>Spirituality and Religion</h4>\n<p>Whether through dramatic conversions and visitation or simple meditative practice, the very definition of spiritual means connecting with forces larger than the self.</p>\n<h4>Life and Death</h4>\n<p>Few things move us as profoundly as witnessing these fundamental and universal passages.</p>\n<h4>Epiphany</h4>\n<p>A classic feature of conceptual awe, this is the moment we achieve insight or view an idea in a wholly new way.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<hr class=\"essay-break\"/>\n<p>For those of us who love museums, it’s no wonder that visual design and other sensory encounters can lead to feelings of being transported outside the self. Museums can offer several types of awe at once: Visual exhibits may incorporate music or images of nature. Being surrounded by others creates a collective experience. Perhaps we achieve new insight from seeing emotions or ideas represented artistically. And large sculptures and earthworks offer opportunities to encounter the vastness of scale, not to mention the technical and creative wonders of human ingenuity.</p>\n<p>Consider the installation <em>Clay Houses</em> by Andy Goldsworthy at the Glenstone Museum outside of Washington, DC.</p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2023-91-1-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"modal-2023-91-1\" href=\"#exrr-2023-91-1-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A small stone house built into the side of a grassy green hill.

Handcrafted from small stones, they look like something you might stumble upon on a desolate Scottish moor (fig. 1). From the outside, they appear the same: approximately thirteen feet high, sixteen feet wide, and nineteen feet long, topped by a simple pointed slate roof. You walk in through the first cabin’s wooden door, and it takes your eyes a moment to adjust to the dark interior. You might let out a small squeal of delight or surprise as your eyes settle on a large perfectly round earthen orb in the middle of the otherwise empty room (fig. 2). The orb is much larger than the doorway, substantially taller than a person, cracked and slightly desiccated. How did it get here? Why doesn’t it crumble? Further investigation reveals that it’s made of brown clay from the site mixed with horsehair, human hair, and sheep’s wool. People around you take selfies in front of the orb as if they have just emerged from a giant dirt bubble. You smile at each other. The room is called simply <em>Boulder</em>.</p>\n<p>“What could possibly be in the next hut?” you wonder. This is the artist’s intention.

You step over the threshold. This room contains no object. Titled <em>Room</em>, it is simply plastered with the earthen material on every wall, ceiling, and floor surface, giving the space an ancient, cave-like quality (fig. 3). It absorbs sound and light. Is it a house? A mud-covered church? A gremlin’s secret lair? If it rains, will it wash away? A stone exterior, a mud interior. It is unlike anything you have ever seen. You stop to take it in, to consider. In the stopping and sensing, there is a feeling of alertness, and then peace. Time slows down.</p>\n<p>And finally: the third stone cottage. This one also contains no object, but it holds another surprise. The small room’s back wall recedes in a series of concentric circles that telescope away from the viewer into a false rear wall (fig. 4). The symmetry is perfect, but organic. Circles inside a Euclidean room. The pleasing shapes are universal, mysterious, and safe at the same time. This could be the site of a primeval ritual, harkening back to a womb or a giant owl’s eye or a cosmic wormhole. The room is titled <em>Holes</em>.</p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2023-91-4-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"modal-2023-91-4\" href=\"#exrr-2023-91-4-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Close-up image of a wall from *Clay Houses* that recedes into a series of concentric circles back into the hill outside of the wall.

Tender.</p>\n<p>But did you experience awe?</p>\n<p>Let’s break it down.</p>\n<p>Did you experience a sense of surprise and the feeling that this is something out of the ordinary? Decidedly so. What about a sense of mystery? Probably so. Many questions likely arose about both the artistic intention and the technical fabrication. The rooms are made from mud, and yet while much of Goldsworthy’s work is ephemeral, <em>Clay Houses</em> is deceptively sturdy. On a deeper level, you may very well have sensed the mystery behind the human desire to affiliate with biophilic materials and the universal shapes represented. What about vastness? In these rooms, you may have marveled at the time required to hand build the stone structures and the installations within. You may have even subconsciously connected to a deeply evolved sense of human pleasure in these shapes and materials, something that ties you by an invisible thread to your ancient ancestors and to all people. The installation speaks to time, to space, to collective memory. In the presence of this art, perhaps you felt your individual self to be slightly less significant.</p>\n<p>In case you’re wondering if similar experiences have led you to a classic encounter with awe, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania along with Italian colleagues developed an “Awe Experience Scale” that encompasses six domains.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> In it, viewers rate their responses to such statements as “I noticed time slowing,” “I felt my sense of self was diminished,” “I had the sense of being connected to everything,” “I experienced something greater than myself,” “I had goosebumps, or felt my jaw drop,” and “I felt challenged to mentally process what I was experiencing.” You can add up your scores and see how you fared.</p>\n<p>It’s important to acknowledge, though, that not everyone experiences awe in the same way. As individuals, we have different capacities for awe, just as we have different dispositions to feel optimism or fear.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> Some of us are more jaded, less playful, less open to mysteries, and less prone to having goosebumps or a tingly feeling when encountering aesthetic stimuli. According to research in the emerging field of neuroaesthetics, about half of the population generates goosebumps in response to art and poetry (nature, music, and other stimuli aren’t typically measured).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> The personality trait most closely associated with this tendency is openness, characterized by curiosity, exploration, and comfort with novel experiences.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Several years ago, University of Utah psychologist Paula Williams and colleagues made an interesting discovery. They already knew that “aesthetic sensitivity,” i.e., the capacity to be moved by beauty, is associated with prosocial engagement, pro-environmental attitudes, and a sense of connection to the living world. Using brain-imaging data from the Human Connectome Project, Williams’s lab discovered that people who responded positively to the goosebumps question also show greater resting-state connectivity in the white matter in their brains. They show strong neural connections between the sensory-motor parts of their brains and the parts that make up the default mode network, sometimes considered the seat of the self.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> The goosebump people are also the ones who report being the most resilient after stressful life events.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams was interested to know why. What was the relationship between being awe prone and being resilient? The brain connectivity itself could be part of the answer. People who are moved by art appear to have an ability to take the sensory stimulation—the chords of a sad song, the vastness of the Milky Way, the pleasure of biophilia—and reflect on their own lives and journeys. When we feel connected to our ancestors or to living plants and animals, we feel less lonely. We gain perspective on our problems. We feel the universality of our plight.</p>\n<p>Experiencing awe through art amplifies our narrative tendencies, enabling us to connect with the stories being told. We become active participants, cocreating meaning and finding personal resonance. We may find metaphors in the art or build on the artist’s creation to tell ourselves stories about our values, our own growth, or our place in a larger world.</p>\n<p>The meaning-making theory sounds grand, but Williams has another, more physiologically grounded explanation tied to the slight discomfort we feel when we encounter a novel mystery. The goosebumps themselves—similar to the raised hackles on a dog’s back when facing danger—may be a mini version of a threat response. When we experience something we don’t understand, our nervous system pays close attention. Is this safe? What is happening here? Think of sitting near the horn section during a performance of Beethoven’s Symphony no. 5 in C Minor. The second phrase of the first movement ends with a climactic horn solo in which the sound wave vibrations enter the listener’s body in a dramatic, unfamiliar, even unnerving way. And yet, soon, the listener is wholly caught up in the emotional height of the music followed by the resolution of tension. It’s not an easy or mild experience. As the late neurologist Oliver Sacks put it, “Music can pierce the heart directly.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>Awe thrives in the face of mystery and the unknown. Experiencing aesthetic awe in this way may be a sort of practice for the stresses of life, argues Williams. “The term I’ve come to use is that it’s a kind of stress inoculation,” she says. “If you do it a lot, then you are always challenging your system a bit and perhaps training yourself to have comfort with novelty and things that are challenging.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup></p>\n<hr class=\"essay-break\"/>\n<p>Of course, not all awe makes us uncomfortable, or at least not for long. Many things that are novel are also highly pleasurable. Accordingly, there are other neurological and endocrinological bases for why we feel good when we encounter awe. One study indicated that while watching videos depicting acts of moral courage, subjects produced more oxytocin, a neurotransmitter linked to emotional bonding, a sense of unity with others, and overall positive well-being.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> Encounters with awe may also release dopamine and activate reward networks in the brain.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>For a paper published in the journal <em>Emotion</em> in 2015, researchers in Keltner’s lab at UC Berkeley asked one hundred undergraduates to fill out questionnaires assessing their levels of different positive emotions such as amusement, contentment, joy, pride, love, compassion, and awe.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup> The subjects also supplied saliva samples to measure an inflammatory cytokine called IL-6. Chronically elevated levels of this molecule are associated with stress as well as numerous illnesses including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and depression. In the study, those who recently experienced awe had healthier levels of IL-6, and awe was the only positive emotion predicting lower levels.</p>\n<p>Neuroscience studies suggest that awe also quiets down activation in the self-referential default mode network as we either think less about our own dramas in moments of amazement or we connect our problems in a more holistic way to the external stimuli.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>Real-world studies in the field confirm awe’s tendency to diminish our egos. In one, researchers asked tourists at both Fisherman’s Wharf (a commercial destination in the city of San Francisco) and a scenic overlook at Yosemite National Park to rate their experiences of awe and draw a picture of themselves on graph paper. The Yosemite tourists experienced far more awe, and they also drew their bodies as 33 percent smaller than the urban tourists. They also wrote their signatures in smaller penmanship.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup></p>\n<p>After the spectacular solar eclipse in the summer of 2017, psychologists at the University of California, Irvine, analyzed the language of seven million Tweets.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup> Tweets sent from the cone of totality used significantly more universal words like “we” and fewer individual words like “I.”</p>\n<p>Hermann Hesse said it well, if a bit verbosely, in 1926:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whenever I experience part of nature, whether with my eyes or another of the five senses, whenever I feel drawn in, enchanted, opening myself momentarily to its existence and epiphanies, that very moment allows me to forget the avaricious, blind world of human need, and rather than thinking of issuing orders, rather than acquiring or exploiting, fighting or organizing, all I do that moment is “wonder,” like Goethe, and not only does this wonderment establish my brotherhood with him, other poets, and sages, it also makes me a brother to those wondrous things I behold and experience as the living world: butterflies and moths, beetles, clouds, rivers and mountains, because while wandering down the path of wonder, I briefly escape the world of separation and enter the world of unity.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those feelings of noninvolvement, even when brief, are very good for our mental health. In lab experiments that induce awe, volunteers report a reduced awareness of day-to-day stress and feelings of being less hassled. Either because of improved moods or because of something particular to awe itself, volunteers engage in more generous behaviors, for example sharing money earned in computer games or folding more paper cranes for tsunami victims.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n<p>As Keltner puts it, “Awe is about as good for your mind and body as anything. It reduces inflammation, so it’s good for your immune system. It activates the vagus nerve, which is good for your cardiovascular system. It’s good for your basic digestive processes. And it’s good for your mind. Even ten minutes of awe makes you feel less self-critical, less stressed, less in pain, more creative, and more of just about all the things we care about in the well-being literature.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></p>\n<hr class=\"essay-break\"/>\n<p>It’s one thing to feel good in the moments during or right after awe. But emerging science also suggests that awe may be the primary mechanism by which people achieve long-term improvements in symptoms of PTSD, in addictive behaviors, and in feelings of fear around terminal illness.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup> Nowhere are these results more apparent than around the therapeutic use of psychedelics. In an extensive series of case-controlled studies at Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic &amp; Consciousness Research, where patients are administered psilocybin (a derivative of “magic mushrooms”), more than half of them report cessation of clinical symptoms a year after treatment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup> They also report enduring feelings of gratitude, life satisfaction, humility, and well-being. In the high-dose groups, most patients encounter a scientifically assessed “mystical” experience, which is very similar to high scores on the Awe Experience Scale. They see visual patterns, feel that time is suspended, believe they are receiving epiphanic truths, and experience feelings of unity together with a loss of ego. It is, essentially, awe on Miracle-Gro.</p>\n<p>In a 2018 paper in the <em>International Review of Psychiatry</em>, Professor Peter Hendricks of the University of Alabama speculates that intense or “big” awe is transformative because it breaks down established patterns and narratives of self-concept. What’s left in their place are new valuations of the self and a profound sense of belonging and connection. “For those suffering from depression, end-of-life distress, or other conditions marked by rumination,” writes Hendricks, “attention diverted away from the self and toward the transcendent (e.g., family, community, the external universe, a belief system) is likely experienced as liberating if not sublime.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup></p>\n<p>As Keltner and Haidt put in their 2003 paper, “Awe-inducing events may be one of the fastest and most powerful methods of personal change and growth.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup></p>\n<p>Awe researcher Michelle Shiota at Arizona State University agrees, believing that awe opens a rare window of opportunity to change our belief systems about the world and about ourselves. In those moments of amazement, we can reconsider everything we thought we knew. We can form new allegiances and beliefs. But this isn’t always a good thing, she points out. Cult leaders, religious figureheads, celebrities, and politicians utilize the trappings of vastness and physical and moral beauty to gain or indoctrinate new followers.</p>\n<p>As Shiota wrote in a 2021 paper, “Awe seems to produce a little earthquake in the mind, a moment of cognitive malleability offering a chance to expand and reconstruct one’s mental model of the world. The model that emerges depends on what happens in the moments during and after encountering the awe stimulus. We still know far too little about that phase of awe.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">29</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, she recommends we go out of our way to experience awe, on our terms, often. “Keep your eyes open; notice the unexpected,” she suggests. “Seek out new music, literature, visual art, dance, or drama, and learn to appreciate these art forms more deeply . . . the goal is to deepen your understanding of the art form so that you recognize the revolution, the extraordinary achievement, when you encounter it.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup></p>\n<p>If big awe can be transformative, what about small awe, the kind we are more likely to run into on a regular basis?</p>\n<p>Many psychologists say yes. While grieving his brother, Keltner sought out narratives of moral beauty, reading biographies of Gandhi. He made an effort to regularly lose himself in music, listening at home and occasionally attending symphonies. Hofstra University PhD student and awe researcher Marianna Graziosi sought relief over the death of a loved one by watching her toddler niece play in the gentle surf of the ocean.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup> Michael Amster, a medical doctor and the coauthor of 2023’s <em>The Power of Awe</em>, writes of resolving his depression through finding small moments of natural beauty throughout the day. He calls this practice “micro-dosing awe.” He now prescribes daily awe to his patients suffering from mood disorders and chronic pain.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup></p>\n<p>In fact, says Amster, beauty is all around us. But we need to pay attention and look for it. As Walt Whitman, the patron saint of awe-seekers, wrote, “A leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">33</a></sup></p>\n<p>When we practice tuning into daily moments of beauty, we can learn to get better at cultivating awe. At the same time, we’ll be cultivating a more resilient mindset grounded in curiosity, cognitive flexibility, mindfulness, and creativity, says Utah’s Paula Williams.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">34</a></sup></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, it was easy to find awe. Our ancestors looked up at the sky every night. They sat around a fire and told stories of courage. They danced and sang together. They regularly encountered wild animals. They searched for and cherished fresh water and living plants. They worshipped and contemplated cycles of nature. Our capacity to experience awe no doubt helped our species survive, as it allowed individuals to recover from stress. Moreover, it helped bond us to each other to forge the cooperation necessary for our evolution.</p>\n<p>If experiencing the sacred and the awesome are so good for us, and so good for our social fabric, what does it mean that we are living in a manner so disconnected from nature, and increasingly, from face-to-face interactions?</p>\n<p>It means this: the burden now falls upon art and culture to help replace the daily awe we used to receive from the natural world and from each other. While the Milky Way is now less accessible, art has in some ways become more accessible than ever before. Online platforms and virtual exhibitions allow individuals from diverse backgrounds to encounter awe-inspiring creations regardless of their geographical location. The intersection of art and science has given rise to awe-inspiring installations that merge aesthetics, technology, and scientific principles. Viewers can experience full-sensory immersive wonders that offer windows into the mysteries of the universe and the complexity of ecological and human systems.</p>\n<p>As a society, though, we need to keep improving access to the arts. Opportunities to experience awe should be more equitably distributed across race and class. To be our best human civilization, we should be expanding arts education not shrinking it. We should be teaching children how the natural world works and allowing them to spend more time in outdoor classrooms.</p>\n<p>Encountering awe is central to the emotional and creative core of being human.</p>\n<p>As Goethe once wrote, “I am here, that I may wonder.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fnref35\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">35</a></sup> Mary Oliver agreed, writing, “Let me / keep my mind on what matters, / . . . which is mostly standing still and learning to be / astonished.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup></p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This story is recounted in Dacher Keltner, <em>Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Life</em> (New York: Penguin Press, 2023), xx–xxiv. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Dacher Keltner, personal communication with the author, April 2023. <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Keltner, <em>Awe</em>, 36, 39–41. <a href=\"#fnref3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt, “Approaching Awe, a Moral, Spiritual, and Aesthetic Emotion,” <em>Cognition and Emotion</em> 17, no. 2 (March 2003): 300. <a href=\"#fnref4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>John Horgan, “Who Discovered the Mandelbrot Set,” <em>Scientific American</em>, March 13, 2009, <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mandelbrot-set-1990-horgan\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mandelbrot-set-1990-horgan</a>. <a href=\"#fnref5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn6\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Keltner, <em>Awe</em>, 10–18. <a href=\"#fnref6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn7\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>“Clay Houses: Boulder-Room-Holes (2007–2008),” Glenstone Museum, <a href=\"https://www.glenstone.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/QR-Code-Sheet_Goldsworthy_11-18-2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.glenstone.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/QR-Code-Sheet_Goldsworthy_11-18-2021.pdf</a>. <a href=\"#fnref7\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn8\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>David B.

It encompasses both the physical and psychological dimensions of our relationship with the environment we live in.</p>\n<p>One powerful manifestation of topophilia is the connection between individuals and their homeland. More than just a physical location, homeland embodies a complex web of personal and collective identities, cultural values, and historical narratives. It frequently evokes a deeper set of attachments than those predicated purely on the visual. The bond between people and their native land is often forged through generations, shaped by shared experiences, traditions, and a sense of continuity.</p>\n<p>One’s homeland can act as a source of inspiration, shaping an individual’s perception of themselves and the world around them. It provides a sense of rootedness, a place where one feels deeply connected, understood, and welcomed. The connection to homeland nurtures a profound sense of attachment, fostering a longing for the familiar and a desire to protect and preserve the essence of one’s cultural and geographical origins. It is a fundamental part of human existence, contributing to a sense of identity and shaping our relationship with the world. The following projects explore the connection between people and places. Each reflects a native ecology or landscape, conveys a distinct sense of one’s culture or homeland, and supports a deeper understanding of the multiple manifestations of biophilia.</p>\n<p>A collaboration between Tohono O’odham artist Terrol Dew Johnson and the New York– and Tucson-based design studio Aranda\\Lasch, the <em>Desert Paper</em> series embodies the rich material history of the vast Sonoran Desert (cats. 1–3).

Johnson skillfully combines these various elements with a natural pulp paper, which is then carefully draped over bent screens to form expressive and irregularly shaped baskets. Each vessel in the series is a unique work of art, characterized by its distinct texture, color, and appearance.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"2022-161-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"desert-paper\" href=\"#2022-161-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A light sandy-brown, textured basket construction.

Bordered by the majestic Andes Mountains in the east and the vast Pacific Ocean in the west, the country lays claim to the second largest and most active chain of volcanoes in the world. The <em>Remolten N1: Revolution</em> series pays homage to Chile’s volcanic landscapes and celebrates nature’s ability to create beauty through volcanic activity (cats. 26–28). With each eruption, magma emerges from the earth’s surface. Molten lava transforms the existing terrain and cools to form an entirely new landscape until the next eruption occurs. Within the confines of their studio, gt2P replicates this dynamic natural activity. The process begins with the harvesting of basaltic andesite, a lightweight and porous black rock, from Chile’s Osorno Volcano, located in the Andes Mountain range roughly 650 miles south of Santiago (fig. 2). A landmark of the Los Lagos region, the 8,700-foot-high snow-topped landform towers over Todo los Santos and the shores of Llanquihue Lake. While Osorno is one of the most active volcanoes of the southern Chilean Andes, it has not erupted since 1869. Osorno’s activity is dominantly effusive, with magma rising through its surface and flowing out as viscous lava.</p>\n<p>After collecting the volcanic stone, gt2P grinds it into a powder, applies it by hand to the surface of stoneware structures, and then fires the objects in a kiln, treating the volcanic powder as a ceramic glaze. Through extensive experimentation, gt2P discovered that the melting points of certain volcanic rock perfectly coincide with the firing temperature of porcelain. This convergence enables the lava to melt as the ceramic hardens within a specific temperature range. By adjusting the firing process at various temperature curves, they control the resulting colors, resistance, and surface texture, yielding an array of unique objects such as planters, side tables, stools, mirrors, and chairs.

Argentina’s grasslands biome has been severely transformed by human development, including the long-forgotten region buried beneath bustling Buenos Aires. Kehayoglou began portraying the pastizales as a way of recounting and acknowledging the past. <em>Bajío</em> (Lowland) corresponds to a small fragment of the Paraná Delta, an exceptionally biodiverse landscape in eastern Argentina that lies near the country’s largest metropolitan areas (cat. 40). The Paraná Delta faces irreversible ecological change due to urban growth, unsustainable agricultural practices, and the consequences of climate change. The carpet is especially personal, as it documents an island in the Paraná wetlands where Kehayoglou lived with her family during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Kehayoglou’s connection with her homeland, however, is both natural—drawn from the landscape—and man-made, a product of her family’s multigenerational manufacturing presence in Argentina. Kehayoglou’s family has operated a factory that has been making industrial carpets for more than sixty years. In this way, her work represents the reciprocal dynamics of human ecology theory. Both halves come together as Kehayoglou re-creates ephemeral native landscapes with a physical manifestation of her family’s history. Tuan’s concept of topophilia exemplifies the complex dynamic of Kehayoglou’s artistic practice: “the affective bond between people and place or setting. Diffuse as concept, vivid and concrete as personal experience.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Spanish artist and designer Nacho Carbonell’s <em>One-Seater Concrete Tree</em> pays tribute to the sun-soaked Mediterranean landscape of his childhood home (cat. 8). Born in Spain, Carbonell spent his formative years with his family in Valencia before moving to Eindhoven in 2005 to pursue his studies. It was only after leaving Valencia that Carbonell discovered the fundamental role the region’s natural environment played in shaping his identity. In response, Carbonell created a body of work that explores his memories of the geography that defines his previous home, from the picturesque Mediterranean coastline to the rugged mountain ranges. Carbonell explains the influence of these natural elements: “I just take them, and I appropriate them because they are part of me, and I use them. I feel entitled to say, ‘Okay, because we grew together, I can use you in my work to create this narrative for others, to let them know that you exist here.’”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"ptl-24710-1-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"tree-inline\" href=\"#ptl-24710-1-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A big armchair, from which one large metal trunk grows with a metal mesh cork presenting as the crown of a tree.

Its highly textured, bulbous metal mesh canopy appears to have organically sprouted from the rugged concrete seat designed for one person. Organic and tactile, <em>One-Seater Concrete Tree</em> possesses a vitality that suggests a living organism, achieved through Carbonell’s use of various textures and man-made materials such as metal mesh, steel, and concrete. As viewers take a seat, the functional sculpture comes alive, arousing their imagination and transporting them to the semiarid Mediterranean landscape that Carbonell vividly remembers, or perhaps triggering memories of their own. Carbonell clarifies, “I want them to look at their own context, to open the door and they are able to see that beauty exists in any other part of the world. We only need to look outside.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> Ultimately, Carbonell’s artistic vision is an emotional response to his own past, expressed through experimental forms and materials.

The architecture and urban design practice’s thirteen-story, 135,000-square-foot hotel takes its name from <em>Populus tremuloides</em>, commonly known as quaking aspen, which is the most widely distributed tree in North America and an instantly recognizable symbol of Colorado. The texture and rhythm of the hotel’s sculptural facade are strongly tied to its function. A series of forty-six thin vertical scallops, each as wide as a typical guest room, envelops the entire structure. Five distinctive window types, from dramatic ground-level arches to smaller openings, punctuate the hotel’s exterior surface. Their unique shapes are inspired by the distinguishing patterns found on aspen trunks. As the trees grow, they shed their lower branches, leaving behind peculiar eye-shaped marks on their thin, papery bark. The windows are also designed to respond to the interior spaces and functions. Some rooms feature windowsills that integrate seating or desks, while at the building’s base, thirty-foot-high openings frame entrances and provide views into public spaces. As Finnish architect Juhani Pallasmaa once remarked, “Architecture is essentially an extension of nature into the man-made realm.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> Studio Gang’s Populus captures the essential attributes of a serene grove of majestic, straight, white-barked aspen trees, right in the heart of the city of Denver.</p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2023-31-3-essay\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"populus-inline\" href=\"#exrr-2023-31-3-essay\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Architectural plan of the side of the Populus building showing elevations and window modules.

The complex is made up of thirteen mountainous towers intended to evoke a natural Chinese landscape. Placed along the edge of the site, the lofty structures are delineated by their vertical white glass fins that flow like waterfalls. The development’s elevated vertical park features meandering pathways that serve as an invitation for people to wander among water features, gardens, and buildings. At the center of the site is a village-like community of low buildings, connected by footbridges and nestled into the landscape. By bringing people up from the busy street level, MAD has created an inviting landscape integrating the different elements (fig. 5).</p>\n<p>The Nanjing Zendai Himalayas Center seeks to challenge the prevailing typology of rectangular, homogenous, linear structures that have shaped our urban environment. In describing cities as “steel concrete forests,” MAD suggests that our urban environments fail to match the thriving ecosystem of a forest and argues that a forest requires a state of symbiosis between every organism.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"vid-exrr-2023-44\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--vimeo\"> <div class=\"q-figure__media-wrapper q-figure__media-wrapper--widescreen\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <iframe allow=\"fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"q-figure-video-element q-figure-video-element--embed\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/911666850\"></iframe> </div> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"\" href=\"#vid-exrr-2023-44\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 5</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">MAD Architects, Nanjing Zendai Himalayas Center, Nanjing, China, 2012–21. © MAD Architects.

As individuals and communities become more disconnected from the natural environment and uprooted from their traditional homelands, the need for a sense of place and belonging grows stronger. Topophilia offers a framework for understanding and nurturing our emotional connection to the physical spaces we inhabit. It reminds us of the profound impact that our surroundings have on our well-being, identity, and sense of rootedness. By exploring the diverse manifestations of topophilia through art, design, and architecture, we can foster a deeper appreciation for the places we call home and cultivate a more sustainable and harmonious relationship with our environment.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Yi-Fu Tuan, <em>Topophilia: A Study of Environmental Perception, Attitudes, and Values</em> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1974). <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Tuan, <em>Topophilia</em>, 247. <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Historically, the Tohono O’odham inhabited an enormous area of land in the Southwest, extending south to Sonora, Mexico, north to central Arizona, west to the Gulf of California, and east to the San Pedro River.

At the time, Aranda\\Lasch’s process was primarily influenced by algorithmic thinking, and they were intrigued by the repetitive and generative process of basket weaving, as well as the mastery achieved by weavers such as Johnson. Early collaborations between Aranda\\Lasch and Johnson considered weaving algorithms literally, using computer programming to generate structures that were executed with traditional materials, resulting in baskets with atypical forms, such as a series of metal loops or interlocking concave and convex planes.</p>\n<p>The baskets in the <em>Desert Paper</em> series are more formally recognizable as vessels, but their unique materiality creates unexpected textures and shapes. Formed from paper created out of a slurry of desert matter and natural pulps, the baskets appear delicate and lacy or thin and rigid, with irregular and curling edges. This new approach reflects Aranda\\Lasch and Johnson’s shift in focus from basket processes to functions.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"2022-160-2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"detail-inline\" href=\"#2022-160-2\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Close-up detail image of Desert Paper 02 basket.

For the <em>Desert Paper</em> series, Johnson gathered regionally and culturally significant materials such as yucca, wildflowers, creosote, agave, and stone from the Sonoran Desert around Tucson and Sells, Arizona, the capital of the Tohono O’odham Nation. These components remain visible in the finished baskets: in <em>Desert Paper 02</em>, the otherwise pale fibers are flecked with the vibrant pink of globemallow petals, and in <em>Desert Paper 09</em>, the paper surface skims over creosote twigs (cats. 1 and 3 details). To Johnson, the usage of these traditional materials in experimental baskets is a reaffirmation of contemporary Tohono O’odham identity. The place and physicality of the Sonoran Desert is fundamentally inseparable from the work, linking the baskets and their weaver to a continuing tradition of Tohono O’odham craft and knowledge-sharing and rooting them firmly in a sacred landscape.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p class=\"is-aligned-right\">Kit Bernal</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Terrol Dew Johnson and Kimi Eisele, “What a Basket Can Hold,” Border Lore: Heritage and Culture of the US Southwest and Northern Mexico, September 3, 2020, <a href=\"https://borderlore.org/what-a-basket-can-hold/\" target=\"_blank\">https://borderlore.org/what-a-basket-can-hold/</a>. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n","contributor":null,"length":844,"subtitle":null,"title":"Aranda&#92;Lasch and Terrol Dew Johnson","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/topophilia/object-plates/aranda-lasch-and-terrol-dew-johnson/"},{"content":"<p>Alexandra Kehayoglou’s hand-tufted, textural rugs are slow and intimate representations of history and landscape, ranging in size from individual prayer rugs to carpeting entire rooms.

One of her most monumental works depicts the Santa Cruz River, Argentina’s last glacial river and a sacred space for the Mapuche people, where two hydroelectric dams are planned for construction (fig. 1). To become familiar with these landscapes Kehayoglou embarks on extended research trips where she takes photographs, makes sketches, and color matches yarn samples.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> For 2023’s <em>Bajío</em> (Lowland), the artist drew on a more prolonged and encompassing type of research: Kehayoglou and her family moved to a small island in the wetlands during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immersed in the landscape, Kehayoglou witnessed firsthand the ecological disturbances in the region, as well as the perseverance of nature. The specific area represented by <em>Bajío</em> (Lowland) exemplifies this, as the river carries seeds of plants from the denser northern wetlands, depositing them into a changing landscape. The patches of texture and color in <em>Bajío</em>, re-created in her typical loving detail, can be viewed as a conversation between Kehayoglou and the land, a process the artist describes as “decipher[ing] those messages that would allow us to transform unbearable loss into hope” (cat. 40 detail and fig. 2).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"ptl-24707-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"modal-default\" href=\"#ptl-24707-4\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Topographic rug, with various shades of green and brown.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/PTL-24707~4.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"\" href=\"#ptl-24707-4\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Cat. 40</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Alexandra Kehayoglou, <em>Bajío</em> (Lowland) (detail), 2024.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Hand tufted wool; dimensions variable, largest piece 90½ × 137¾ in.

The building’s bright facade and varied, oval-shaped windows are a motif that is familiar for many Coloradans: They resemble the white bark and dark “eyes” of aspen trees. On an aspen, these characteristic marks are left behind as the trees self-prune, shedding their lower branches to expose more of the photosynthetic bark, which absorbs light and energy year-round. For Populus, the eye-shaped windows, the largest of which are thirty feet high, accomplish the same effect, providing light, views, and, for some hotel rooms, built-in seating. Extended “lids” over each window redirect rainwater and create shade as an efficient response to the harsh Denver climate; these considerations of local and environmental impacts can also be seen in the architects’ decision to have no onsite parking, encouraging visitors to bike, use public transit, or explore the neighborhood on foot.</p>\n<p>Aesthetics are not the only similarity between the hotel and aspens. A cluster of aspens seems to be made of many individual trees (fig. 1), but they are all extensions of the same vast, underground root network, a single part of a larger organism. In the same way, Populus is informed by and will impact downtown Denver as a whole, despite being just one building. By drawing on a quintessential aspect of the regional environment, Studio Gang designed the building to resonate with local residents, adding retail, restaurants, and a public rooftop garden and view deck to create opportunities for connection and community (fig. 2). While Populus takes its name from an aspen’s scientific classification, <em>Populus tremuloides</em>, the homophone “populace”—the inhabitants of a designated place—is also an apt moniker.</p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2023-31-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" data-modal-identifier=\"diagram-inline\" href=\"#exrr-2023-31-5\" data-modal-additional-slides=\"false\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"diagram of the Populus building.
